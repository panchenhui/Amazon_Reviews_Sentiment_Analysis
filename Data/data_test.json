{"label": 0, "data": "I will say that it totally worked as advertised,  Unfortunately, I was really looking for a simple interface to transfer files between my PC and my Kindle, and this software does not do that.  What this does is allow your supported tablet to act as the display and keyboard for your PC, allowing you to run software and view files that are hosted on your PC, but displaying the output on your tablet.  Its as simple as that.  The tablet is not actually receiving and using the PC's files and programs, it is just displaying what the PC would be displaying.  This could potentially be useful, but happens to be much slower that just working on the PC.  Also as other comments have noted, there are some security risks if used over the internet."}

MESSAGE TO CREATOR: A fun update for this game would be a level where it is has a base like the other levels but instead of the game being over when the blocks miss the platform or when they&nbsp;land on the platform but do not stack on top of each other the game is not over but you keep on building to build your own tower creation until a 60 second clock ends and for each block you get 1 point and one point for each layer of blocks that have been stacked, and then there is a high scores place where all of your scores are kept highlighting your highest score, and finally there would be an Amazon Game Circle place for the highest scores for the kindle fire users. Also maybe if you can make a store where can but stuff with the points that you would earn, items like different blocks or maybe something else like different screen backgrounds. I hope that you consider this as an update for Tower Craft Builder, Multinetz. Thank you. !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"}

That it's why I rated it so low. It's more like a &quot;demo&quot; so you get hooked to pay for the full version. Also, the pop ups at the top of the screen get annoying.

{"label": 0, "data": "Pros:- Attractive game for young players- Runs smoothly on Kindle Fire 8.9- playable off-line- FAOTD is possibly the only reason people will get this gameCons:- repetitive game play- constant in-app purchasing (IAP) options- Facebook/Twitter links for little reward- fails to utilize Facebook as a means to permit competition between friends- Paid for application contains in-app purchasing (when not the FAOTD)- purchased items can be used up exceptionally quickly- Game Circle add-on (why do developers even include this garbage?)- Levels (even the first level) are designed to keep players from earning 100% stars without using up IAP itemsATTENTION PARENTS! - Please be fully aware that disabling the ability to make IAPs is my recommendation if you turn your phone/tablet over to your child.  I know this ability is possible on the Kindle Fire HD and I honestly hope it is also available to you.  The addictive nature of this game is unlikely to exceed the teenager market, so I suspect that is Playmous' targeted audience and consumer.

Received no feedback from my complaint, no refund, and now I see they have reduced the price to $2.99.  I do not know where to further complain for my refund and am afraid to \"uninstall\" at this point and never get it.  My only chance is an update will make it work.  Mostly angry I wasted $6.99 on something that does not work and now have to see it cheaper.  Also does not even show up when I search the game on amazon apps.  Ugh"}

It can work on a two way camera phone, illuminating one side with a range of colors. It's enough to light an entire room if you just set it down on a surface and walk away, or just light your entire path in front of you. It hasn't failed me yet and I've used the app during a three or four night power outage. Definitely saves on batteries as well, considering you can now charge your phone in a car if need me."}

You can type in a question and it will show you others who have asked the same question and the corresponding answer. Or you can ask a specific question and wait for a live doctor to answer it for you. This is better than Web MD which I used to use. Now I just use this. I give this a five star rating, it is that good!"}

Also, if you have more than one location for weather set, and when you are able to start app, it will not bring up your current location, so you have to scroll through your other locations to find your current weather, really kind of annoying!!

I played through a couple of rounds and lost interest.I didn't hit a board that was too hard, I just didn't care about it.  There's no back story as far as I know.  What did the pigs do?  Why are the birds angry?  Haven't pigs learned about more stable building material?  I ended up putting it down, though my wife picked it up and enjoyed it -- right to the point where it became too hard.I think part of this is the Fire screen.

{"label": 0, "data": "I found this too irritating to play because of the poor interface. Whenever I would try to drag a puzzle piece from the list, it would scroll instead. You have to tap and hold the piece before you can move it to the puzzle area which ruined the flow of the game. Furthermore, everytime you picked a piece it would get needlessly magnified which made it hard to place, particularly when moving a larger cluster of several pieces.I didn't like that there was no frame for the puzzle, so the pieces were always just &quot;floating&quot; and you couldn't lock them in place. This also meant that the most recently selected pieces were always on top, hiding other pieces beneath them. In a better designed game, once you placed a piece in its correct location it would go to the background and become unselectable so that you only need to click on active pieces, and they would never be hidden.Another irritating thing was that the puzzle wasn't scaled to my kindle fire, it was just a few pixels too big.  I only tried the first kitten puzzle but quit from frustration."}

{"label": 1, "data": "Note: I'm on a Mytouch4G with Gingerbread. I also own an Acer Iconia A500, but haven't tested on that, yet - as of 9/12/2011You may want to go for something more hardcore if you're worried about your phone being hacked/stolen. I can think of a few ways to get around this if I REALLY wanted to get into someone's phone. So please keep that in mind. This isn't a sanitary app, meaning it can't secure or wipe your data if your phone is stolen. This is just to protect your phone from snoops or people who may accidentally change your settings, etc.If you just want to protect your device from nosy kids, family members or coworkers this is THE perfect little app.I used this overnight to see if there are any bugs and such and I haven't found any. One thing I've noticed in some of these reviews is that people tend not to read or pay attention to warning and such, then rate the app down because of reasons already noted in the apps documentation.My advice to you is to read the information here on Amazon as well as in the app. Add the app to the ignore list if you are running a Task Manager (aka Battery saver apps, etc.). The app automatically 'secures' apps it deems dangerous, such as settings and market, task managers and file managers. These are the many places that users may access to uninstall/remove/force close apps - if you remove security on them and then are able to go in an close/stop/remove the app then how is that a fault with the app?Seal is extremely simple to use. Secure apps by adding them and then setting the icon to green. Doing this makes it so whenever someone tries to launch the app either a password or visual cue needs to be satisfied in order to run it. You can set it to just about anything on your device. I got the app because I had a situation where my little cousin borrowed my phone and promptly purchased Asphalt HD 5 from the handset (practically 2 touches) and voila, $7.99 on my TMobile bill.There's also a situational list so you can add/remove security to various apps, based on the situation. There's always the few base apps you want to secure that I mentioned above. In addition to those, at work for example, you may want to secure browers, im apps, email apps, etc; at home you may want to secure your games or demos so your kids don't buy them accidentally or perhaps your IM so your wife doesn't find out about your anniversary surprise, etc; or you may want to lose all security altogether when you're the only one around. It's all up to you.The app gets a big thumbs up from me. There may be more potent and powerful apps out there - but I don't need those. This works just right."}

I've done this with a couple of other apps because she asks me,but it's  getting old! Most other girls will be covered simply changing the model's hair,and eye color.

Surely there is another way to gain proceeds for your apps,add even more extras including pets,vehicles,spouses or a career background and I'm sure you'll get even more purchases.

While I could deal with the minor technical glitches the other reviewers cited, the inability to watch this on the TV set was a deal-breaker. That appears to be intentional from the developer as the Kindle insists you unplug the HDMI cable to proceed with viewing.

If you wish to sit down with your family and watch the same on your HDTV, you'll be disappointed."}

The facebook prompt came up, as it does with nearly every game nowadays, but we logged in and started playing. If you liked temple run/subway surfers, you should feel at home. Same controls as both, just new scenery. One of the main problems I ran into was the constant facebook-oriented missions. These became quite annoying almost to the point where I felt like deleting it. The only other gripe I have is with despicable me 2 out in theaters, why have they not updated the game to include the mall as a playable level? Two stages gets boring, which was the main reason I deleted the iron man game; that and outrageous iap's and grinding times. So if an update enables you to play the mall it gets 5 stars. Sure, you have powerups like in subway surfers and the ability to challenge friends on facebook, two stages just doesn't cut it. You decide."}

We downloaded all versions of it - the classic has annoying ads - and even downloaded it to two different devices. At no time did any word that meant anything come up. We are not the type to read into the words and expected the ghosts to explain themselves, not us making up the explanation for them.

A little bit of a challenge at times but nothing to serious.The only problem I really have with it is that the online does suffer from the occasional lag at times. I think it's mainly because having a ton of enemies on the screen at the same time is just too much to handle and it slows down the game. Other than that, It runs smoothly.Overall, It's a simple yet fun app to play and it's free so why not given it a chance?"}

{"label": 1, "data": "This is a cute little game.....Graphically this game is a little dated. The Dibbles and the worlds that they inhabit are however quite charming, and that adds enough appeal to the look of the game to make it visually interesting. The worlds do get a little boring to the eye late in the game, however, they never become an eyesore.The music and sounds are truly top-flight. The sound effects are cute and fit the Dibbles personality very well. The background music is excellent, and, conveys all the drama that one would expect from a game that requires you to sacrifice your players in order to advance......and yet never so severe that it ruins the whimsicality of the game.......... they are not people... they are bugs ....some of them ARE gonna give thier lives in service to the Dibble King.....The gameplay itself is where the game starts to falter a little bit. While the controls are spot on , and, the game mechanics are explained in perfect depth........ the game itself is just too darn easy. There is really no challenge at all.......even in the later levels.Dibbles offers only 33 levels, which is way too few for a game of this type. Considering that none of the levels are ever really going to \"stump\" the player for very long it is entirely likely that this game can be completed in under an hour. (It took me around 45 minutes) ...................Thats just not enough content........This game DOES NOT CONTAIN IAP.There are other Dibbles apps offered thru a \"More Games\" link on the Dibbles menu screen. This link will take you to the appstore and , if you choose to do so, allow you to purchase either the Winter Themed or Pro pack dibbles games. These purchases are made thru the Appstore proper. Unlike IAP's these purchases are subject to Amazon's purchase protection, can be bought with gift cards, will remain in your Amazon apps collection once purchased, can be downloaded on multiple devices, can be restored after uninstall or upgrading your phone and represent ACTUAL CONTENT....... not game exploits like super dibbles...... Kudos to Difference games for maintaining this level of sales integrity, and for demonstrating that the customer actually matters to thier company!A full walk-through of the game is offered at no charge to anyone who is willing to install their \"GameHub\" app. Its not very likely you would need a walk-through in this game, but, it is there if you do. If you don't want to install the \"GameHub\" there are plenty of resources online that offer the same info.I am going to rate this game as average, which is 3 stars.I am subtracting one star from the rating for lack of challenge and one star for the extreme shortness of the game.I enjoyed the 45 minutes or so I spent guiding the Dibbles thru the various lands....... I just wish there was more to the game...."}

{"label": 1, "data": "This is my second FlipPix Art collection and I'm enjoying these little logic puzzles quite a bit.  This collection contains 252 puzzles, one of the most puzzles for a collection for FlipPix.  Some might say they like more objects per scene, but seriously, what does it matter, it's about the puzzles, not the images.I do have one issue with the 20 x 20 puzzles, and that is they do get rather small for some screen sizes.  Keep this in mind when you purchase this app.  I run it on a Kindle Fire HD 8.9 and my stylus would not be able to handle a smaller screen.  In all fairness though, my stylus is more like a pencil/eraser than a tiny toothpick.It would be my suggestion that after completion of all of the puzzles, the game gives an overall rating/percentage to the player.  Maybe incorporate a timer for an even harder level of difficulty.  It is for these &#34;minor&#34; reasons alone I only give it 4 stars.  If this was the first release of the game collection for GabySoft, I would have easily given them 5 stars, but after several collections, one would have thought the developer would have come up with more features to the game, and not just new images.Looking forward to more FlipPix releases."}

{"label": 0, "data": "So this isn't even an beta version?  EA is shipping alpha stage products to paying customers now?I guess that would explain the bugs.  The worst bug is that the trading screen is utterly broken; tapping anywhere selects properties almost at random.  There is a display bug in the history window that makes it look like I'm paying rent twice (at least I hope that's a display bug and not the computer cheating and taking my money twice!)  I also had a hard time selecting a game room; you could swipe right easily, but it only registered swiping left 1 out of 5 or 6 times.  I only played for about 15 minutes, so there's probably a bunch more bugs I haven't encountered yet.In the time I tested the app, after selecting the house rule to evenly distribute the properties and with 1 AI opponent, I landed on the computer's properties 10 times and the computer landed on one of my properties 3 times.  That's not really a big enough sample to prove the AI is cheating, but it does seem to show some bias.The AI offers absolutely terrible trades.  The computer asked for Boardwalk, giving it a monopoly, and offered two low rent properties that didn't give me anything.  Riiiiight...$5 is a bit much for an app even the publisher admits isn't even a beta yet."}

THUS, I choose an easier oponent!!!!Well now after playing this game awhile, I have discovered somehow, it learns!

I like that there were new areas to explore constantly rather than staying within one space. There were two cons:1. One piece of the game keeps you having to go back to the same spot each time you find a certain type of object. This means that you may have to back out of numerous areas only to have to reenter immediately. This got tiresome very quickly.2. The ending was really abrupt. You think you've finished it, then it turns out you haven't, but then it ends really quickly when you feel like you're just getting back into it. Not a fan of that."}

{"label": 1, "data": "This is a very cute game and I really like that it does not require an internet connection.What I absolutely do not like is that by level 19, I am almost stuck on quests.  I have four quests:  (1) requires an Ent tree with no hint on how to get one (they are not available in the tree menu  (2)wants fortune cookies which apparently are easier to get if you have a fortune tree which costs 120 gems - without it, I have two fortune cookies thus far by level 19 (3) the only one I am actively working on now - requires growing a variety of plants (4) requires a peacock which takes 200 gems.The issue is that the main way to get gems is by leveling up or completing quests - unless you do what they want you to do and buy them with real money.  I am very willing to patiently play a game but this game is continuing to close doors by offering fewer and fewer quests (one out of four now) that are not pushing you to buy gems or else to wait a very long time to earn enough gems by leveling up (at one gem per level) to complete one quest.Since you also need gems to do things like expand your land beyond the first expansion, you quickly eat into the supply you earn making it very difficult to complete the quests that require items that cost a lot of gems.  Note that all animals but one cost gems.I think the game needs better explanations or an online FAQ somewhere to answer questions not answered in the quest instructions or by exploring the menus(such as where does one get an Ent tree) and far more quests that don't require items that cost a lot of gems in order to complete them so that you can get a few gems.  I will continue playing long enough to complete the one quest I am on that does not require gems, but if that is also replaced by one that requires gems to complete, that will be it for this game for me.It is not that I am not willing to spend money to support games that I enjoy.  I do so regularly, but I want it to be my choice, not something the developers try to force me into by making most of the things needed to progress in the game almost unobtainable in any way other than to pay for it with actual money.  Even though I enjoy this game, I will not spend money on it because of the way I feel I am being corralled into a situation where I have very few choices if I want to progress in the game.11_09_12 edit  The Ent did show up, was a tree with a different name.  Figured that out when I gained another level and the pictures matched even though the names did not.  It does not change my overall opinion though that this game pushes too hard (by making too many required things only available for a lot of gems) for you to spend real life money."}

Oh and he goes to the bathroom like a little boy, haha. He will let you know what he needs through your notifications. If you don't take care of him he'll put on a sad plain face. But feed him different foods or pet him and you'll make him/her happy. I wish we could have more different types of food to feed him . You can also earn enough to change his clothes if you'd like. Make him wear glasses, a Santa hat or afro hair. It's up to you. Oh and he does require a shower which he actually likes. But don't touch his feet or tail. Punch his tummy.Hit him three times in the face n knock him out.Or her, cause I guess you can make him a girl. And there are cool games like Memory, connect lines, and others. Wish there was more to do like taking him outside so hopefully the makers will consider. I always like to make reviews on my fave apps. Okie dokes. Have fun. At any age.

{"label": 1, "data": "If you like the screens in hidden object games where you have to find 20 needles or 18 fishhooks, then this is the game for you. Every screen is like that, but with objects like birds, ladybugs, butterflies, and bees.The background images are very attractive. On many screens you'll see a couple of obvious finds, and the rest are faded into the background to a greater or lesser degree. It can be tough for find the last four or five objects, but you will always have a hint available to help you with the last one, if you desire. As you progress the screens don't seem to be particularly more difficult than the last one, just different.While any fan of hidden object games might like this app, it could be particularly attractive for children who are too young to follow the stories or figure out the puzzles in some of the more complicated hidden object games.I dock a star only because the game is a very simple version, and it probably won't hold your interest for repeated play, although you'll enjoy taking a look at it the first time through.If you do a lot of random tapping, a warning sign will fill the screen for a few moments, delaying your progress. I found the game to be on the generous side when deciding if you had tapped on an object.I played this with a Kindle Fire HD 8.9 with no problems.ETA: For a while I had a typo in my review title, calling this a \"Harming hidden object game\". I'm surprised I got any helpful votes! LOL"}

{"label": 0, "data": "Today I opened this app and thought at first that my Kindle Fire HD had caught a virus.  Instead of showing me a clean, well-organized screen displaying useful information about the weather, I was presented with a screen asking me to sign up for some kind of social media game or marketing promotion involving accumulating points.  Once I bypassed that, I encountered various windows with navigation designed less for viewing the weather than for viewing banner ads.  With more clicks through this visual mess, I eventually found the weather forecast.  I then learned that this is not the result of a virus trashing my Kindle but of a Weather Channel revision of the interface.  It looks like the goal was to increase time users spend on the app so as to present more advertising to them.  Guess what? Advertising doesn't work when no one uses the app anymore.Despite the new mess of an interface, this app can still be used to find out about the weather, so it isn't completely useless.  But now I will probably be using a different app as my go-to weather one."}

The software simply stopped working and I hadto restart the software.The software, is relatively slow, especially in Kindle reading books which are are 100 M bytes in size or so.I am using this software to read the ext books with illustrations and figures.  The performance is slow, and whenchanging the orientation of the screen, it process may take 10-20+ seconds.  The text books converted tobe displayed by the bookshelf are at times very poorly done.  The conversion of illustrations are broken down intosmaller displays which must be expanded to be viewable, and at times, one images on the text book is brokendown into multiple subimages, which can not be seen at the same time.The text book conversions are not ready for the prime time.  I prefer reading the real books 10 times as comparedto the implementation done in the Bookshelf.Most of the text book can not be expanded; the only thing you can do is the increase the font, but this does notincrease the image sizes.

The challenges were really difficult to see,  such as those where the items to be found were silhouettes without any color or real definition.4. There were only 3 different type of mini /games and in 2 of the 3, I never understood how these should be played - so after trying to solve the first few,  I just skipped  the rest.5. Although the hype for the game claimed 50 plus rooms,  there were actually only about 5 or 6 that the game kept reusing - what a bore!6. The story line might have been good,  but was manipulated so that the play stayed in one location for several rounds and always used the same silly challenges - find the silhouetted objects,  find the transparent objects,  find the list of items and so-on.7. Lastly,  the graphics were poor and the settings could not be enlarged enough to be clearly seen.Finally,  I really felt cheated by having paid for such a crappy game."}

I'm very happy he played with this app one evening -- I thought he was too young to do these puzzles but was able to complete a good amount of them with little or no help. I quickly realized he's ready for this stuff and am now looking for some more apps around this level. Some of the puzzles were tricky at first, but after playing them a few times he can now do every one without any help.  This app has been a great entertaining and educational app for my son.My main gripe about it is just that the sensitivity for proper piece placement seems to be a bit too picky... the puzzle pieces are really big so it's not hard to tell which outlined spot the user is trying to place the piece into, yet many times you aren't quite close enough to the center for the app to consider it placed properly and the piece will fly back over to the side of the puzzle... it's a minor thing except that very young children have a hard time knowing if they placed the piece poorly or if they are actually placing it in the wrong spot.It is a very simple app both in appearance and functionality, but it definitely does a good job at being both fun and educational for young children while also being very considerate of the target users of this app by leaving out all of the in-app purchases, external links, etc. I wish more kids' apps were as kid-friendly as this app is."}

Not so much as the ability to press a character's face to get a quote, or a hide and seek game, or anything. You may as well just buy an actual book!Also it should have had about twice as many pictures, because the pictures don't always make sense with the story.Case in point: One of the earlier pages shows Eep (the girl) sunning herself on a cliff. The narrator describes that scene, and then goes on to describe a \"bear owl\" attacking Grug (the father). However it doesn't even show that happening! It still shows Eep relaxing while the narrator is describing an action scene. It does this ALL THE TIME. There are many scenes that aren't shown because not enough pictures were included.Again though, if you have a small kid that loved the movie, they'll probably be kept busy by this."}

There was a few times I had to use the hint button due to hard to find objects. That kept it engrossing. It could be a touch longer, but for the price it's worth it.

Most of which you have to play the same game 2-3 times to advance.  And they're not fun after the first time.  Some, but all have a skip button, but it takes too long to charge.I play with sounds off so i can listen to music.  There is a puzzle where you have to match sounds of ringing bells.  So I don't have sound on and can't skip it, and there are lots of bells.  I know I can turn sound on and work through this, but I am so fed up with the minigames that I just deleted it.There are very few hidden object scenes.  Most of those are the kind like \"find all the wrenches.\" That gets boring quickly too.I recommend against buying this.  Especially if you are hearing impaired or can't tell different tones of the bells, this is useless for you.Shame on you nevosoft.  Other companies use lights to match and let you skip all minigames.

The tutorial is ever-present, offering hints on how to get started, but is not obtrusive.* Good graphics and fairly intuitive gameplay.Cons ...* It's impossible to \"lose\". You might not get the gold medal (or trophy) but the game continues indefinitely. That can be frustrating, because at some point, there doesn't seem to be anything to do, and yet you haven't completed your objective(s). The game does seem to require, especially after the first phase (state), that you constantly reshuffle your resources, destroy what you've built, and essentially start over just to complete the final tasks. The tasks are, for the most part, similar if not identical from level to level. I lost interest when it seemed that I had to do something to achieve an objective, undo what I did, then do something else just to achieve the next objective. Part of the problem -- and almost certainly this is by design -- is that land space is incredibly limited. You'll never run out of money, which is often a problem in similar games; the cash continues to flow in at an incredible rate.The game is interesting for a while, but the lack of solid progression in terms of complexity prompted me to set it aside less than half-way through."}

{"label": 1, "data": "Kings Can Fly is a 'directional' game similar to many railroad games, where you have to direct the traffic from entry to exit.  Why there are multiple balloons, I'm not sure.The developers went to great length to ensure the player is well-tutored, and the overall game is quite attractive.  There aren't any ads, and while I don't like analytics, it is easy enough to get around that by blocking the app with a firewall or other measures.Unfortunately, there seems to be a bug in some of the Kindles where the game is upside down, hence many of the one-star reviews.  I personally think that is unfair; a three-star rating for a bug should be enough in my opinion, and when fixed should be re-reviewed or removed.  We've seen a lot of junk apps that do deserve one-star ratings, and this is NOT in that class of bad app.There are a lot of levels, but not a whole lot of challenge.  It would have been nice to have additional obstacles, goals, and directional tools.  Still, for a buck it's worth it; but if additional content and more difficult levels are included, I think this has a chance at being a five-star game for the 99-cent price point.[As an aside, take a look at this game and Cubimania; both are built on the same engine, but are not the same developer.]"}

Sometimes your people will get sick so make sure you bye medicine for them according to there sickness. The house needs to be renovated and decorated too. Overtime weeds, socks, dirt and or food wrappers will grow. Drag a person over the junk to clean it up.So the game has pretty good gameplay... but there is NO black people in this game which made me kinda upset. There's only American and Hispanic people. But why only choose between those two!? That's one thing I kinda hate about this game. Another thing is like when there's a fire, leak, etc it's hard to find and pick up the tools needed to fix it.

Your character is a man named Ethan whose fiancee and father get kidnapped into a gang of evil minions. Ethan must rescue them. The game is set in the Victorian era. (Which judging by costume the writers intend to be the latter half..approximately 1900) To answer another person's question, yes mechanical devices existed then. Trains and other steam powered objects were common. Have the game makers gone slightly steam punk with their concept? Possibly so. But I don't find myself too distracted by it.The game has a hint button that's able to help when you get stuck. No guide per  se but it wasn't needed. Overall enjoyable with no glitches.

{"label": 0, "data": "I have been playing for a couple of months now and while there are aspects of the 'game' that I love (the graphics, variety of locations), the farther into the game I get the more technical issues I encounter. The game first began to stutter, the graphics dragged and occasionally froze momentarily, then it froze and went to a black screen before completely crashing. Crashing began to occur every time I tried to play, sometimes as often as three times in five minutes. There are places in the game where play is virtually at a stand still when you need sand, for instance, to create cut marble to proceed with most of your quests, where it takes an exceptionally long amount of time to gather everything necessary before you are able to proceed. Play on 'Mystery Shore' becomes extremely difficult when tornadoes replace Murlod attacks. I've left the game and come back to numerous tree stumps, trees I had not chosen to cut down and I've built a bridge, crossed it, cleared the land, moved buildings onto the land, gone to another island and returned to find nothing I had previously done existed and the timer was still running on building the bridge. Because of the stuttering and dragging of the graphics the game has stolen gems from me, as I tried to click one option, but the game was behind and it misinterpreted my choice. The crashing has increased many times over since the update that changed the seasons within the game.It's a shame there are so many technical problems with the game because the visual design is beautiful. My husband downloaded it too and has been having the same problems."}

I know I will continue to enjoy it.This free game has 10 lovely and somewhat complicated scenes for searching out objects. They are a little more difficult than some games, because of the subject: snow fairies. Consequently, most of the pictures have a lot of bright white areas, and most colors are muted. That makes the hidden items a bit harder to find, and I usually have to rely on a magnifying glass to find one or two items in each picture. I must admit, however, that I just played through the 10 levels, at about 1AM, so the difficulties I had could be because I am tired, not to mention OLD.I recommend this game for those who like a bit of a challenge in some beautifully rendered scenes. Do as I have, get the free edition, and if you enjoy the more complex search and the lovely scenes, the full game in only $1.99."}

(absolutely no instructions) Every tap of the screen loses you a life and when you lose you start over again.Summary:I did not enjoy this game at all and for me it was a waste of time. It is already removed from my device and in the cloud. You are trying to interpret what you see on the screen and figure out what the developer thought would be a way to accomplish the goal.

{"label": 1, "data": "One of the biggest issues I have had with my Samsung Tab 3 is the inability to quickly swap application windows.  Sure, I can home screen out, sometimes waiting a few seconds for my home screen to load in, then dither about, sometimes even longer, trying to find the app I want amongst the myriad of icons.  I have repeatedly reorganized my home screen icons to cut down the dithering... but APPOINT PRO is exactly,  yes, EXACTLY the -customizable- window swap ability I have been wanting.  There is nothing useless about it in my case.I have looked at each permission carefully,  considering what the app needs to do, and every single permission is legitimate.  If anyone has any particular permission question,  feel free to leave a comment,  and I will answer, but otherwise dealing with each would take up far too much space.As for the adware, I have oft said in the past that I am not quite as heavy handed against addon code that is essentially benign (although I do deeply dislike advertising spam).  There is no advertising spam here, however.  I cannot see if the adware is active or not, yet the -inactive- adware in that HELIDROID game does come to mind.  I encourage the app developer to contact us to elucidate.Nevertheless,  this app is MAJOR improvement to my Android life.  Perhaps you can think of it as a 2nd home screen layer although it certainly moves a lot quicker than my home screen button does.  I can swap between my review entries to other apps, such as OfficeSuite Pro- and here is the big kicker- without having my review field resetting.  That's right, sometimes when swapping between apps via the home screen with a partial review written,  I would come back to an empty review box because my browser window refreshed.  Not so with APPOINT.  WOOT!There quite a few different custom settings; one to particularly note is to specifically diasable the BOOT AT START permission.  You can also customize the \"tap point\" with a picture, change transparency, size, etc.  The add app section even has an internal search function.All in all, APPOINT is a personal 5 star app for me, finally giving me one of my most missed Windows-based conveniences, the ability to QUICKLY tab from a custom list of applications- something the long press home button doesn't do, and it's line of applications gets as large as my actual home screen.  The adware still gets docked a star until the developer tells us if a) the code is inactive and/or b) will be removed.*The developer has stated that the adware code is absolutely inactive, being a shared source with the Free version of APPOINT.  As was the same case with a previous FAOTD, this is far more than sufficient to give APPOINT a full five stars.  Once again, utility is purely subjective, and inherent to ALL Specialized Utility Applications that have a FAOTD showcase, it may or may not fulfill general public personal desires.  For those who want the added interface (like myself) will love it, and for those who do not yearn for such a utility... well, will probably won't like it in the least.*"}

I have played up until you get your own ship to go whoever you want and have hit auto on every fight, even boss battles. Won every single time. Have not died once (except where you have no choice) just by maintaining equipment. Magic is interesting but ultimately useless as auto kills everything. Combat becomes a joke at this point.

No matter how much you grind to improve, you will have to eventually spend money to be better than the average player. Honestly, spending some money (to a point) for a good game is not that bad, but they lose a star for it. As to customer support, I have had to contact them three times in less than three months of playing. One time, they were very helpful. The other two times, they blew it off. This was especially stressing when multiple players reported a glitch. On that one, they never even bothered to respond to ANYONE. One star off for that as well.

{"label": 1, "data": "Test devices:Samsung Epic, Android 2.3 officialViewsonic gTablet, FrankenTab (Android 2.2)First up, those of you that didn't alternate between pumping quarters into arcade machines and blowing into your game carts when they didn't work right will probably want to skip this. For the rest of you, this app is easily the best way to bring back some old memories of when gaming was young.Atari's Greatest Hits Pro comes with a nine games (4 arcade and 5 2600), unlike the free version which only comes with Missile Command. The remaining 91 titles can be purchased in 3 game packs for $1, or get the whole collection for $10. Games are broken down into roughly 17 arcade titles and 83 Atari 2600 titles. So, if you buy the whole deal, that's ten cents per game. Transactions for purchases are handled though Amazon, which takes away the worry of charges from unknown vendors.The visuals are very good, as is the sound. Some may complain that the sound isn't reproduced exactly like the original, but one has to remember the speaker(s) in their device aren't exactly known for quality sound reproduction. You're certainly not going to get the level of bass out of them that many of them that even a generic TV can do.The biggest worry I had was the control set. In each game, the software offers up multiple control schemes. Each scheme is set up so to make the game easy to play based on how you like to hold your device. I tried out each set on both phone and tablet, and they worked well. They worked even better when I changed the sensitivity setting that Atari thoughtfully put in. Switching between the larger screened tablet and phone was a little difficult as I'd become used to where the virtual buttons were, but in no time I was able to adjust and play well.My gripes about this app are very small. The biggest complaint is that if you bought some of the titles through the free version of the game, they don't cross over to the Pro version.  Also, UI doesn't keep the Back button in the same place. Sometimes it's at the top, sometimes at the bottom. I'd prefer it to be consistently in one place or the other. And finally,while pausing a game is nice, so I can come back and continue to play it later, it would be nice to be able to exit back out to main menu and play another title instead of having to continue the play the original one.All in all, I love it, and spent the $10 to get all the games (via free version)."}

Point and click adventures are my favorite and it is hard to find many for kindle. If that weren't the case I would never have sprung for the overpriced $5 for the full game ... at least what I thought was the full game. Now I admit I get irritated by reviews that whine about adventure games having a free intro. Anyone who has played more than one or two of these games knows there is no such thing as a full version for free. Get a grip. However it is customary for the paid unlock to contain the entire game. When I got cut off at the end and realized it would cost another $2 to complete the game, I was not happy. As far as I am concerned, that is a bait and switch. So, like a sucker I paid for the ending. The big shock came when I had completed it in 10 minutes! I will never touch another game by this developer, and I hope other people have enough warning not to get sucked in. You ought to be ashamed of yourselves. When you ask people to pay for a game, they have a right to expect everything in one price. Buyer beware."}

{"label": 0, "data": "I got this as the free app of the day today from Amazon.This is an app featuring recipes of many Italian dishes for those of us that aren't used to cooking Italian like Criminal Minds star Joe Mantegna.Unfortunately, this app is by no means a substitute for a great Italian cook like a Joe Mantegna or a Rachel Ray.The pictures are very nice looking, but the recipes are confined to a little space so that you can only see a few short lines at a time making it impossible to see the entire recipe at the same time.  You have to constantly scroll the little window part at the bottom of the screen to see the entire recipe which is very inconvenient.This app requires a WiFi connection just to access the recipes, so it you are cooking at a place without WiFi you are out of luck trying to use this app.In addition to the above problems, there is also confusion to what the i button at the bottom is for.  Once you press it, it seems to take you to a list of ingredients.  But when you press it again, it goes right back to the same page you are currently at.Another thing I don't like is that there is a link to an About Italyum video on the main menu page that is on YouTube.  If you are going to have your app connect to the Internet to show YouTube videos, why not do this to show the dishes being prepared?Since we can't have Joe Mantegna come over to our house to make these kind of Italian dishes, I am giving this app a 1 out of 5 stars since the images are nice looking, but unfortunately there isn't much else positive to say about it."}

It gives you the option of finding by picture, silhouette, or word and you also have the choice of timed, untimed, or challenge modes. I'll give it four stars because it does what it's supposed to do and has these options. The background graphics are fine, too. However, the objects that you have to find have nothing to do with the backgrounds. It's like they're thrown at the screen by some random object generator. There are things like ponies, frogs, books, pens, bags, etc. all over the place with  no rationale for their placement. A shelf can be hanging out in a tree and a clock somewhere in mid-air. I guess the objective is to get rid of all the junk - but it isn't much fun.Update: I finished all levels. I thought maybe I can keep playing to clear all the random objects from the pictures but it doesn't work like that. In each game, you are just given some of the objects to find. If you replay the level (which is a pain to get to because you're always automatically bumped to the next level when you complete a game) the pictures reset and you're just given another random set of objects to find. All the objects that you had previously cleared are back. So you never get the satisfaction of clearing a picture completely. This is a shame because the pictures themselves are quite nice but are spoiled by all the unrelated objects strewn all over the screen."}

I guess they're trying to be some kind of portal as well but I don't care about any of it. They don't even let you pick which sources you want the news feeds to come from. Yoy can only select from a pool that THEY deem is interesting. So much for not \"filter bubbling\"...This is supposed to be a search app. If I wanted news I would have downloaded CNN. Stick to the job, boys! Just keep it at search and nothing else and get rid of all that other nonsense! Two points off for that junk!"}

{"label": 1, "data": "This game is very straight-forward and easy to use as there are no fancy gimmicks built into the game and no in-app buys.  However, there is advertising just about every hand that is dealt so until one gets used to making that disappear quickly it can be a little annoying.  I do understand that this is the other side of a completely free app, but thought you'd like to know.  All in all I  play it often because of its simplicity."}

We have mastered it already, but still like it. You match the shape they show you and drill that screw in with your finger, saw the matching number boards, put a matching piece of pipe in to fix the water leak, and match car parts by color and shape. There are interactive &#34;prize&#34; rewards every so often then too, that we like to mess with. Like I said, it's really cute and my child loves it, but I wish they made it a bit more challenging too."}

{"label": 1, "data": "I installed this program this morning. I like it a lot, but there are 2 things that stop me from REALLY liking it.1.  There does not seem to be an easy way to modify the title of the note. You have to use the keyboard on the Kindle Fire screen. Some way to do the job within the note would be much better IMHO.2.  Notes export well to Evernote, but do not sync so you have to manually delete the older version in Evernote - unless I am missing something."}
{"label": 0, "data": "Overall, the gameplay is very weak. For the most part it will require a fair amount of somewhat random tapping to solve the hidden object puzzles. There is little guidance, and plenty of solutions can't really be discovered with logic. For example, you may find a magical staff to use in a puzzle, but not know what it does or when to use it.If you are only interested in this app for the gaming element you will almost certainly grow bored of it before finishing the game. Fortunately, the story element is a bit stronger than the gameplay, so if you take time to read the dialogue or listen to the full-script voiceovers you might stick with it long enough to finish. Its &quot;OK&quot;, but unless you've already played all of the best this genre has to offer, there's plenty of similar titles that are far more entertaining."}

Although this isn't the best game ever it is still a fun time killer if you're not a hater. It has a lot of different places and basketballs to use and play at. It is worth the money. But if you are a hater than don't buy this just to get angry at it. It's a flipping 0.99 cent time killer and a great one at that."}

I noted that a coupleother players experienced difficulties at a certain point in the game.  Since I haven'treached that far, I'm not sure what I will find.

You also need to have slim fingers or the &quot;bubbles&quot; end up going every direction except the one you are aiming at.  I highly reccommend using an inexpensive (&asymp; $2.00), soft, spongy tipped stylus for less frustration.  If you are going to use this type of stylus, do not exert much pressure when you move it across the face of your Kindle (or other &quot;android&quot; device) as the greater the pressure you apply, the more drag you will notice in moving the stylus!"}
