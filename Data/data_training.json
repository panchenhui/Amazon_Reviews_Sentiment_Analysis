{"label": 1, "data": "I really liked this game - very good graphics and story. There's a nice amount of point and click with lots of inventory objects to collect. You must return to each location several times over and over, but it didn't bother me nor feel like the game was drawn out.I did have a problem with the size of the text in the hidden object scenes - the words were tiny and hard to see. The screen zooms, but if you don't know what you're looking for, then that is sort of useless. There is also a map which shows each location you have visited and indicates what is left to do at the location: either a \"blocked entrance\", \"point of interest\", or \"hidden object scene\". However, the map is tiny and quite hard to see. The entire game graphics are rather dark, which is consistent with the werewolf theme, but I would have liked to see things better (yes, I turned the brightness up all the way).Overall a very engaging game, but like the other reviewers, I had a real problem with the price - $4.99 to unlock the full game (and $1.99 MORE for the bonus chapter!!) This is just too much - especially when you aren't one of the big 3 developers in this genre. And for an android game, this is double what other games cost. I know ipad games like this cost $4.99-$6.99, but this is android! You do get to play the game for free with a 1 hour time limit and then get 10 extra minutes if you join the developers newsletter by submitting your email address. I didn't buy the full game - I want to, because when it ended I had only played 2 chapters and had 4 more to go. However, on principle, I'm going to wait for the developers to lower the price. If they did that, I think a lot more people would buy the game."}

When this app was made available on Amazon App-store the love for Toothless dragon character made me download the app. Overall I do like the app. The storybook presentation is cool especially for young kids. But even at my age I flipped thru' all the pages and loved the graphics.The mini-games included in the app is simple but if you love the movie and the characters I can see a child enjoying playing the mini-games. It does work without internet access for most part. There is some amount of privacy issue (Device state and Identity) which I fail to understand why the developer really has a need for this in a paid app? thankfully there were no unwanted ad-ware modules that I could see using my app scanner. The main problem in this game is that Android *back* button will !!close!! the application from memory and if you hit that *back* button accidentally it loses the game's progress and makes you start all over again! (Very frustrating)Having said, If you love Toothless and missed out on the day it was offered for free $2.99 might be little too steep IMHO for storybook app to buy today. If you can live with the back button annoyances then 99c would be appropriate price for this app hence - Overall Three stars!"}

The view/perspective is hard to manipulate accurately and you can end up not knowing where the flag is on the longer obstacles.

{"label": 0, "data": "Survival mode is a killer feature of PvZ transforming it from a game that lasts 2 hours to one that can be played pretty much endlessly.  Last stand is one style of play in a mode extras that lets you set up a full slate of plants at the beginning instead of building it over time, and is a great mode to earn gold on.  The zen garden let's you collect, water, feed and sell all the plants in the game.  All these modes contribute heavily to the general addictive-ness of the game, and once they're all gone, some of the magic is too.I imagine the survival mode was left out over performance concerns.  You know morons would leave 1 star reviews because their 2 year old phone couldn't hack that many zombies on screen at once, so none of us get to enjoy it.  Harder to imagine why popcap left out the zen garden or so many bonus modes like last stand.  If it's a matter of money, I'd happily buy an expansion, but without the content even being available, I've got to dock some stars from the score.The full PVZ experience is 5 stars.  This one is 3.5 stars.  Worth the cash, but only just, and a pretty big letdown for fans."}

After testing for a few hours, I found out that aVIA is unable to list Playlist contents from the Windows Media Player server WMP12).  I can access the contents only when I go directly to the folders. I can see all the WMP playlist that I have created, but not the contents. For example, I go: My Video/Folders/WMP Server.  This lists: Music, Video, Pictures, Playlists.  I can now play any contents from music, video, pictures.  But none from Playlists.  Bottom line is all my playlists created in WMP are useless.It would be nice if they addded the ability to play to ROKU to so content can be played on TV.I bought this APP because the Playto app does not allow continuous play of playlist media. I am still on the hunt for an app that will allow continous play of all my WMP server media. Currently, I use my Sony Blu-Ray player (BX-58) to stream WMP video playlist contiuosuly to my TV, but it won't do music."}

After selecting OK, it goes right back to the screen asking if I want to login to Facebook or play as a guest.Another problem is that I cannot click on the Notifications that it gives me when it is reminding me to collect my bonus and play. The notifications show up just fine, however when I touch it, it does nothing.  I have to clear the notification, then go to the app &amp; open it to play.Another big problem I have with it is not being able to close the game.

{"label": 0, "data": "I didn't bother downloading; I really don't like this new trend towards in-app purchasing. I realize that you can block that capability by changing the configuration, and I might not take such an exception if the default was opt-out rather than opt-in. But if the developers aren't making enough, they just need to set the purchase price appropriately and then let the customers determine if the game is really that good.Edit: I emailed the developer and after a very quick and courteous response I looked further into in-app purchasing; I was under the assumption that you had to do this for each app that had this capability, but it's actually just one setting in the Amazon Store.  So, it's not as bad as I had first thought; I downloaded the game, disabled the Amazon settings and verified that I couldn't purchase anything in-app, so I bumped my rating up by one star.I still don't care for this whole in-app purchasing system, so I couldn't give it a higher rating than I did, but the developer made it seem like this system is here to stay - apparently it's harder to make a profit on Android than on iOS.  I still don't fully understand the difference between the Amazon paid version and the Google free version, but according to the developer the Google free version may be ad-supported (at some point in the future if it isn't already) whereas the Amazon paid version won't be."}

The graphics in this game are okay at best.  The actual story is less than okay.  It's kind of childish really.  You play as the detective trying to save your friend whose a reporter that went missing. Besides the HO's, which are very basic and easy, there are a couple of cool things that you do.  For example, you have a scenario where you act as an actual detective trying to figure out a crime scene. There are items in the \"scene\" that you have to guess if they are actual clue items.  It's like a HO, but the items you need to find are blocked out. (If you play the Casual level, you won't have any difficulty what-so-ever trying to figure out what they are.) Once you pick a correct clue item, they become visual on the bottom of scene and the item itself will sparkle.  Afterr you pick them all out, you then tap on each item on the bottom of page and the story will play out on what happened to be a crime scene. That part is kind of cool.  You also have a few items to look for throughout the game to be able to open the Bonus chapter at the end of the game.  There are some mini games, but, they too are very simple to accomplish.There is a lot of story dialog throughout the game, but you can skip it, or even help it along by tapping \"continue\".  (The words appear on top of page so you can read it instead of listening to the characters.)  Another VERY annoying thing about this game, is you're asked to give a \"5\" star review CONSTANTLY throughout t he game!Overall, the game is simple to do.  I wish G5 would have come up with something a little more like their old games.  Better graphics and a little more challenging.  But, when you have to wait so long for a game to come out, you can't be too picky I guess."}

{"label": 0, "data": "It looked like it had promise. The graphics seemed professional, it started off shaping up like a graphic adventure game, and then it went South.  My first mission involved an unlikely, if mildly humorous (emphasis on &#34;mildly&#34;), encounter with an alien ship which I was then to do battle with.  The battle consisted of waiting what seemed like an eternity for my weapons to charge, a quick firing of the weapons using a completely illogical user interface, seeing my enemy's shields (then ship hull) drop by a percentage and then waiting once more for my weapons to charge.  In between weapons charges, the enemy would charge his weapons (at better than double the rate of mine) and take a couple shots at me, which never seemed to affect my shields in any way.  Also, about once every two attacks, my &#34;jump&#34; drive, or whatever it was called, would charge and I could, ostensibly, use it to evade enemy fire.  It had no user interface -- apparently one just activates it at the appropriate time (with no guidance as to when is the appropriate time) and it discharges.  Since my shields were never affected whether I &#34;evaded&#34; fire or not, there was no feedback as to whether  I was using it correctly or not.  This went on until the alien's ship was destroyed which seemed to take, oh, about 2 months off my (not my character's) life.  That was quickly followed by my second mission which was prefaced with a suggestion to hire more crew and build more &#34;rooms&#34;  on my ship.  I couldn't remember how to do the latter, which had been presented in the tutorial which occurred before the mind-numbing, soul-defeating, first battle, but at that point I no longer cared and just forged on in hopes that something better was coming. That proved a vain hope as the next mission apparently had some sort of zombies invading my ship.  This involved just some sound effects which were, apparently, supposed to sound scary, but there was no indication of what I should be doing to battle invaders on my ship, no apparent controls which allowed me to do anything, and no patience left on my part.  I exited then uninstalled the game.  I got this as Amazon's FAOTHD and am ever so grateful that I did not pay a dime for it.  Now, if I could just get back the part of my life wasted on this lame game.  One final point -- the game uses tokens as currency for hiring crew and purchasing supplies (these tokens are in the game only -- there is no in-app purchasing in this game, perhaps its only virtue).  At one point in the tutorial it showed how to destroy tokens. I guess I will simply have to ponder what circumstances come up in the game which would ever make that useful knowledge."}

There are only a few career options, a few choices for clothing and no modifying the house you get - only change the wall paper and flooring and shop from a tiny assortment of furnishings (only 2 kinds of stoves, tv's, bath tubs to choose from. No more even if the game advances and you get promoted at work.) The only changes you can make to a home is to &quot;upgrade&quot; it which changes the size of the rooms, but you don't get to make any changes except wallpaper and flooring in the upgrade. (Did I mention that the default furnishings are gaudy and mismatched? Orange shag carpet with green walls anyone?)I played through 2 characters to complete boredom in one day.

It does have similarities when compared to classic PACMAN game which we all love so much.The game has no hidden modules and permissions are fine.

But I don't think it deserves that many.Lets talk about the good things first, I bought this for my kindle fire hd from amazon for $1.99 so good price and for that I don't expect a long game so the fact this one isn't very long was okay. Another thing is the puzzles for the most part were just hard enough to be interesting but not impossible. For the most part.  And that brings us to the next section.Lets talk about the bad things.  There were a couple of puzzles that had no explanation on how to solve them.  For example, this is not one of the puzzles as I don't want to give spoilers, imagine they give you five sticks you can swap with each other and tell you to solve the puzzle, and that's it, no more explanation.  You swap the sticks around until enough time has passed to skip but it isn't very fun that way.  Another thing it didn't play that smoothly on my kindle, sometimes I had to tap three or four times to get something to happen.As for the look of the game some of the other reviewers kept saying how good it looked if you play many big fish games you will recognize it as one of theirs, their games do look good but they all look somewhat the same so that got them one star already.  I'm not going to heap praise for a formula they use over and over.So over all okay but there are better."}

The game gets a little repetitive after a while.There are some fun changes to tracks as you go around. One has a middle path that opens up a little more each lap, so by the end you have a triple-jump, with options for doing tricks (to increase your boost).To increase the replayability, I'd recommend giving the tracks a few more alternate paths (there are a few, but they give you an extra jump instead of an &#34;S&#34; curve, things like that).  Or, perhaps add a new track when you master all the different power levels?I've seen that there is a &#34;GP 2&#34;, with multi-player and some additional play modes.

It has a header with all the feature to use your Kindle without having to drop down and hit other and then scroll through you choice. This app also presents a square icon with most of you Kindle tools at hand. Some of the advance features get a little to invasive for me, but I just do not use them. I like simple and this app allows you to keep it that way. However, if your a Tech Head, it allows you to go deeper and have more control of your memory, junk, installed apps, and more. I recommend this app. if you want to keep your Kindle in good shape easily. It even has a nice boost feature. It's a one touch icon to clear memory and give you a clean Kindle."}

I installed this and set it to automatically dim at &#34;bed time&#34; and brighten in the morning when my alarm goes off.  It took some digging to find these settings, but worth the effort to find them.  You can choose the levels of screen brightness with a slider.  The program does not recommend going below a setting of 32 as it could result in a black screen.This program remains in memory at all time.

The HD graphics are top notch and look very smooth on my Tablets.The game makes a reasonable attempt at a plot with a fairly predictable,yet, reasonably engaging story about aliens attacking.

The basic, ultra-repetitive &quot;Tower Defense&quot; game mechanic that drives this game is exactly what you would expect from this kind of game. Events transpire a little too slowly in the game for it to ever feelexciting,however,the thin plotline and better than average graphics are enough incentive to drive a player to complete the game.This would be a solid 4 star game were it not for the integrated IAP, which certainly does not belong in a paid app,but,also would utterly nullify any challenge or enjoyment the game might offer if purchased.The IAP garbage that this greedy scumbag double-dipper of a developer has integrated into this otherwise decent game does NOT sell anything that cannot be earned through gameplay, and the game is not balanced in a way that tries to force the user to commit IAP, so, it is not gamebreaking.4 stars for graphics,  gameplay,  sound ,story and fun factor.-2 Stars for integrated IAP ripoff scam"}

{"label": 0, "data": "The good things about this game are that the concept is good and the art is nice.The controls are horrible though, and the menus are illogical and unintuitive. When I'm choosing which kind of structure to build, I am able to hit the \"next\" button a little less than half the time because it's so small. You need fingers the size of spaghetti to be accurate. Otherwise you just poke and hope and most likely miss. And I've probably destroyed a third of the farms I've tried to make because I wanted to change a pigsty to a grain field during setup but trying to go back just destroys what I just built.There are all kinds of unexplained buttons, symbols, indicators, alerts, sounds and sections. Clearly some will come into play later in the game and will make sense at that point, but for now they're just a mystery. It's hard to tell what's happening at any given point. You come to figure out some of them, like \"I'm producing too much grain/pigs/etc.\" Others though, you just don't know. And when your wife's dialog comes up on screen, it's somewhat confused by poor translation from the original language, presumably French, or by the developer's good-but-not-great original English.If this is version 6 of this game, I'd hate to see what the previous 5 were like. I really wanted a game just like this, so it's disappointing that the potential for such enjoyment is marred by such baffling and poorly designed controls. I'm going to persevere because I want to figure it out, but jeez!I'm on a Droid Incredible 2 running stock 2.3.3 for what it's worth.UPDATE:After sticking with it for several more hours, I pretty much got the hang of it. It's a pretty good game once you do that and I'm upgrading my rating from 2 stars to three based on that. But I only got it through a lot of trial and error and guesswork. And while I'm better at hitting the onscreen buttons, they still don't do what I want half the time because the receptive points are so small and imprecise (just accidentally blew up my university a second ago). That keeps it from getting more stars from me. I'm using a 4\" screen, which is about average at this point, but it would need to tablet sized for these controls to work properly.Also, after pouring about 10 hours into this, I plugged my phone in to charge for about an hour, came back to it, relaunched the game, and all of my progress was gone with no way to get it back. Or that's what I thought. It had kicked me back to the main screen and it looked like I had to start all over. So with a sigh, I did. But fear not. At that point it gave me the usual option to continue or restart. I was able to continue my game. However I had lost my recent progress. Why? I'm not sure. I didn't even think this thing had a save function - I thought it was just automatic. But it's just buried under a seemingly unnecessary \"close\" menu. Most of the time you just click away to some other application and when you come back, your progress is saved. So it seems like it just remembers without a dedicated save function. Except sometimes it doesn't. I just lost progress again in open ended mode when I clicked away to another app for a few minutes. Why? Why does it save sometimes and not others? Like a lot of the rest of this app, it doesn't make sense. It's so frustrating. Definitely makes you want to uninstall.The open ended mode is good for practice I guess but it otherwise pointless. On the screen I chose, there were three enemy forts. I built up my town until I had an army bigger than the enemy and then attacked the two smaller forts. Beat them easily. Then I went for the last fort. I outnumbered its troops almost three to one, plus four propagandists. All my guys died. Then I did it again. Then I upgraded all my forts and my coffee house to maximum upgrade and had maximum troops. Attacked again. Still all my guys died and not a one of the enemy's three. What was the point? This game just doesn't make sense. Going back down to two stars.The one advantage of thinking I had lost my game is that it caused me to click the Help menu on the game's main title screen out of curiosity. Here lies the solution to everything but the poor controls. Everything is explained here - all the icons, buttons, alerts, gameplay, etc. You should definitely read all of it before you start the game. You shouldn't have to - the controls and icons and alerts and gameplay should be either intuitive or descriptive or a combination of both. You shouldn't have to read a whole help file first, but you're going to need to unless you just like figuring out cryptic puzzles by bumping into things and experimenting."}

{"label": 1, "data": "This app is a simple and fun way to learn the melodies of a lot of famous Christmas songs. I've been playing the piano for 15 years, but this app presented a challenge because you are not reading music, but pressing notes to a rhythm that is sometimes hard to determine. I'm using a kindle fire (first generation) which operates on a two-point multi-touch system, meaning that it can only register two pressure points on the screen at a time. This is a pretty severe issue for this app and others like it because most of the songs require you to play three note chords, which my kindle cannot do. If there were a &quot;chord toggle&quot; option to let you turn off the three note combinations and give you a two note equivalent, this app would be much better. The addition of a metronome or other rhythm/tempo signifier would also be fantastic so you know the pace of the song.In short, if you have a first generation kindle fire or other device that uses a two-point multi-touch, don't bother with this app unless you are willing to accept the poor scores you will receive on songs because you cannot play chords."}

Especially 2 vs. 2 team games.3. No penalty for playing invalid words. Allows for trial and error word-mash for high scores. After 3-5 failures, the person should be forced to skip that turn.4. Does not display points for word before playing. This functionality can be purchased, but is overpriced.5. The developer nickel and dimes customers for extremely minimal functionality.

{"label": 0, "data": "Most people, including me, don't mind an unobtrusive ad here and there on freeware. Zynga has taken this to a new high, however. Each time you play, you are taken to an entire ad screen after each move. It sometimes is hard to get away from the screen on the Kindle Fire because of how the bottom menu sometimes won't come up. Or, if it does, there is a second or sometimes third place you have to click on to escape. Or, an ad such as Dick's freezes up and sometimes you even have to reboot. Now they've added 30 second videos you can't escape from. That's my limit. The game is great, but now only for those who don't mind being made a captive audience for ad dreck. It's hard to believe a company which had the nerve to charge $3 for an ad free version took away user's privileges with an update that voided that. Zynga deserves to be boycotted."}

If you put your phone into Airplane mode and start the game, you'll get a Feint offline notice at the bottom of the screen.If you like this sort of game, I'd recommendYoo Ninja! (Ad-Free)instead.

The sound effects are spot on and the gameplay is very smooth.  The interface is fine for my smaller tablet, not sure how good it looks on a hefty iPad though.The reason for losing 2 stars is that a game of this caliber should NOT have typos in it and it does!  Also, the announcer doesn't always know if the contestant is male or female, using the wrong pronoun.  That's amateur stuff that shouldn't have slipped by, especially not on a paid app.Overall it's a fun game and I enjoy playing it and will happily boost the star rating with these small changes.

Now I read that this sequel has creepy rooms and music and somehow everyone's ok with this and something about a seance whatever that is. I'm very disappointed they picked the horror route rather than puzzle like they were supposed to."}

An Apple is like 98 coins, and the cheapest book is over 400! And after the first egg you raise, the eggs are 5,000 and up.But if you're a money saver that should be no problem.As for the learning part, on this game the littler kids learn responsibility, the teens may learn a little style (with all the dress up stuff, the clothes and hair and accessories, you could learn allot about style ;) and ALL ages 1-100 can learn How To Save $$M0N&euro;&yen;$$And a few helpful tips- for the 24 hour castle trial, save that for when you're deeper into the game and you've learned how not to spend so much on accessories. If not then you'll end you being a serious money waster. And always start out with the easiest eggs, and with the egg-on-spoon mini game, NEVER go on rabbit speed unless you're a expert! For the average player always go just between rabbit speed and turtle speed.Over all this is a cute, fun egg game that takes weeks to get bored of. Sometimes the eggs form interesting personalities, and you almost never know what form they are going to hatch out as.P.S.They also pay you to review :D"}

Since the game is centered around assigning tasks which take time, for those timers to repeatedly and frequently wind back is simply unacceptable, especially when several hours of waiting may need repeating.

{"label": 0, "data": "Need I say more? Well, actually I am going to say a bit more, and that bit coaching to be a warning to all of you who downloaded or considered doing so. Basically, there are four robots that you can manipulate to do certain moves, such as :Walk Left, Walk Right, Jump, and Crouch, which are the basic commands you are able to perform on your starting bot. As time progresses in the game, the time limit to perform the action decreases. To unlock the next robot, you must earn a certain score. However, as I found out rather quickly, you don't have to use a higher ranking robot to unlock a robot. I simply used each unlocked bot once, and after finding them harder, I stuck to the simple bot and was able to unlock all four bots in about 15 minutes. Granted, I may have defeated the &quot;purpose&quot; of this app by not challenging myself, but that makes this app either WAY too easy or WAY too hard.  I am bored, and am glad that this was free!

{"label": 0, "data": "I hate to say it, but I really expected more from a (normally) paid app. The list of restaurants is disappointingly short and there doesn't seem to be a way to add up menu items for a grand total. The app is called calorie counter, but it doesn't count anything. It simply allows you to pick a restaurant, look at a list of menu items, and touch each item to see its nutritional values. No pictures, no way to add up the various items to total up the meal, no way to keep track of your history to try to reduce calorie intake and raise protein intake... nothing particularly useful.This was most disappointing when looking at the list of ingredients at chipotle. It lists out the tortillas, chips, salsa, meat, cheese, beans... etc. But no way to build the burrito or plate to know what you're about to eat. I am not a developer, but there is no way this feature would be difficult to add.Lastly, I should be able to enter my calorie intake goals and be able to see where most of my calories come from. Without this feature, it is just an app full of raw data. I am almost certain that I can find all of this information on a single website if I googled it. I really got my hopes up on this app and I can't believe anyone would pay $3 for this raw and freely available information.This app has potential to be extremely useful. Most of my meals come from local restaurants. Add these features and I might just pull out my phone for something other than words with friends during my meal."}

I checked for interactions of 17 medications taken by a family member with multiple medical conditions and turned up four combinations it suggested she review with her doctor. One drug was common to all four--aspirin!

The game is free BUT certain premier robots, such as atom from the movie, costs real coins, which cost real money. Of course they offer you some, they trickle in very very slow at level ups and I dont see myself saving up one hundred coins to buy a level one robot, when you have to PAY to move to the next tier or integrate with fbook, which Im not a fan of. This game tries VERY hard to coax money from you and link to fbook. It is ALWAYS popping up ads and in game &quot;bonuses&quot; to make it easier, costing real money. The game is very slow saving up gears to buy upgrades for bots then waiting real time to equip them, unless bought with real money. Ive been playing for weeks and am stuck on tier two trying to save up to make my bot good enough to win. It feels like the bots are designed to suck till they're better than the one you're fighting and even then getting passed their extra boosts (which, you guessed it, most of them cost real money) isnt easy. I have an alright time with it, but after the first few days I slipped back to playing once a week or sl just because of the sheer frustration.Pros: Getting to kick the crud out of robotsGood graphics, controlsDecently free with EXTREME PATIENCE.Cons: Heavily HEAVILY heavily facebook integratedNot designed to be free, though you can manage its very slow and tedious.Overall they scrape by with a two unless they change those cons, I'd gladly pay .99 cents or even $1.99 for an ADD FREE CASH FREE FACEBOOK FREE GAME!"}

One of the three weapons you get that spreads out the firing effect, can be used over and over again for just about every level and has no challenge at all because the enemies are destroyed at the event horizon, never putting you in any actual danger.This game is not super easy, but is certainly not hard as I finished it in less than a full hour of continuous play.

Turn off your internet connection and you will get the OpenFeint offline message when you start this app.  That would account for the huge data usage I mentioned at the bottom of my review.  So, this app connects us to OpenFeint and doesn't even tell us.  Is it also creating OpenFeint accounts for our devices?  I'm guessing this issues will change this app from a disliked app to a hated app.Original review:Too bad, I was going to rate this app high.  But I have to agree with the other reviewers here that this app is an example of pure greed.  Paying again for something you already had?  Really?  If it was a free game, then the in-app purchases would be justified.  But it's not a free game!  A paid app should be a total app--you should get all the functionality, all the bells and whistles, all the time--you shouldn't have to pay again to play the game the same way you did when you first bought it.The In-App purchases are:$0.99 for 5 more Shields after you used up the initial 10.  (Which doesn't even get you back to the original 10.)$0.99 for 5 more Slowmotions after you used up the initial 10.  (Again, only half of what you started with.)$1.99 to unlock the Rescue level of the Story mode, if you don't want to complete the Run level first.But here's a helpful hint (if you don't mind wiping out your scores): if you clear the apps data section, the initial 10 Shields and 10 Slowmotions will be restored.  (Hey, a way to stick it to the man--or the developer in this case.  LOL)It's too bad really because it's not a bad game.  Its graphics are crisp and move very smoothly.  The controls are responsive and the gameplay is actually fun.  Though, there were a few times when the app did quit without prompting with the Exit (No/Yes) screen first, which was irritating.The multiplayer mode is a bit silly, especially on phones.  Though, I would think it would be pretty tough to play on a Kindle as well--can you really see 4 guys huddled around that device madly tapping on the screen?And the description is wrong.  There are only two game modes, not three (Story and Endless).  There is no \"Practice\" mode.As a side note, the data usage is sort of sucky: even after moving this app to the SD card it still uses 1.23MB of internal storage.  And after playing just a little, data usage is 5.70MB (a total of 6.93MB).To summarize: Greed wrecks a good app."}

{"label": 0, "data": "Test devices:Samsung Epic, Android 2.3 officialViewsonic gTablet, FrankenTab (Android 2.2)Ok, the premise was interesting, a cross of two classic titles, Pac-Man and Snake.  Visually, it's not bad.  The game board is very similar to that of the arcade Pac-Man, minus the power-ups.  Also missing are the ghosts, and their home base is not walled off.  So far, ok.  When we come to sound, the disappointment starts.  No soundtrack, and the sound effects used for gobbling up pellets and fruits are poor, a definite step down compared to the graphics.  The controls are much the same stuff.  The swipe action is spotty, which is a huge no-no in a game like this.  It's still playable, but expect to miss a lot of turns and doing some eating of your own tail.  One can use the trackball or keyboard as controls instead, if their device has these.  Lastly, the game is tied into Scoreloop for high score tracking, but getting to Scoreloop from inside Pac Snake is a no go."}

Typed up a test message, used about a dozen symbols in various places to fit the text and sent it to myself. Worked great. I then sent the email to other people and it didn't work. All they got were rectangles where the symbols were supposed to be. Obviously a mail program or at least some mail programs on a computer where most people read their email aren't capable of receiving these symbols.

As other guy mentioned, the permissions this app asks for, a little strange.

I wish there was a way that one you add something to your meal plan that it would automatically remove it from your pantry, instead of having to go back and do it manually, it might be on there but i havent found it. there are a few things that i wish were different. For example i can not figure out how to delete a category under the grocery list, or how to cross off single items when shopping.. which would be very helpful. also the weekly meal planner set up is a little weird. its kind of  hard to input separate parts of a meal.

{"label": 1, "data": "Ok, I love this type of puzzle, and find it very relaxing when stressed out.  However, the number of puzzles is somewhat deceiving.  Yes, there are a lot, but it uses the same pictures for each level (5x5, 10x10 etc.).This isn't really a problem, since the fun of the game is in figuring out the blocks to check, but it would be a much better game with new pictures for every puzzle.  I don't think the programming would be onerous to do that, nor the memory usage.Having the &#34;paint&#34; button right next to the &#34;trash&#34; button resulted in my accidentally hitting one or the other when I wasn't being careful.  Since I often marked lots of boxes before hitting button, I would have to replay the game due to &#34;striking&#34; out.Overall, average for this type of game.  Controls could be better and visuals could be better.  Would pay worth about a buck, but not much more at this point."}

In comparison to springpad: evernote has cleaner, easier to use features. springpad's notebook page is better looking and u have a social feature where u can follow other notebooks; I did not see that on evernote.  evernote has a few 1ups over springpad, but I wont use it anyway because I don't see why it would need access to so Much personal information.

The sound is great, the gameplay is fast and smooth, the graphics are appealing and the list goes on. I do, however, want to see save files added to the game.

The application bids and plays reasonably well, considering the moderate cost, and probably is best suited to the novice or beginning bridge player.

We appreciate the program's ability to continuously save and maintain the accumulated total score (Ledger).  Some of the display options are not very attractive, and the card size can appear to be too small on some settings.  On our Kindle Fire HDX 8.9, the overall display only covers a portion of the screen, buit the cards, bidding, and function buttons are proportionately rendered in a reasonably attractive fashion.There is no help or instruction available.

{"label": 1, "data": "There are a lot of tower defense games that all play roughly the same with the primary difference being graphics and setting. Jelly Defense sets itself apart with a unique spin.It had the typical trappings of placing towers, enemies wandering down a path, and trying to kill the before they take your goodies. However, it has a clever mechanic where red towers can only harm red enemies and blue towers can only hard blue. There is a red-blue tower that attacks both, but it's a weak attack that isn't fast enough for the quick blue guys. There's also a research tree that opens up new towers on a map.What also adds to this game are the power-ups and giant monsters. At the end of the level a giant jelly will bound down the path and upon defeating it the death animation is pretty entertaining.Both music and sound effects are top-notch and the game has a high amount of polish. Overall, it's an enjoyable experience."}

The idea and concept is entertaining and fun to play. This is where the 2 stars come from. Other than that, the game constantly crashes. Even that alone wouldn't cause me to give it only 2 stars except to get back into the game you have to sit through the entire intro again. There should be an option to skip this, especially as it is a little lengthy. On the plus side, most of the time when you continue it puts you back to where you were. A couple of times it put me a few scenes before where I was. I like the chapter reviews to let you know how you're doing but I think you should be given the option to replay chapters if you missed something. Instead it seems the only option is to restart a new game. This game has loads of potential if the technical errors could be fixed. It IS ad free (as far as I can tell so far) which is nice, but I would be willing to purchase this app if it weren't for the complaints I mentioned above. Fix those and you get 5 stars ;)"}

{"label": 1, "data": "With some similarities to the established double-crossword (or double-crostic), Quote Unquote mixes word definitions with letters in a quotation, challenging puzzlers to use all of the letters correctly.  It is created quite cleverly, with a wonderfully simple UI (user interface) that makes it a very quick game to learn. I found myself moving from puzzle to puzzle, with enough challenge to keep me interested, without making it so tedious or difficult as to become a burden. It appears, from the home screen, that additional levels are in the works, which I look forward to.Update:  6/28/12Sure enough, I was notified of an update this morning; and I now have extra levels in the game!  Furthermore, the update also indicates that another half-dozen levels are in the works, and should be coming shortly.  I'm only sorry that 5-stars is the highest rating I can give, because otherwise I'd make it higher.  Another feature in the game is something I truly enjoy -- a \"Hint\" capability to prevent the frustration of so many other games when you can't continue to successive levels because you're \"stuck\" on one particular level.  Won't happen in this game.  The developers have thought of everything to make this an enjoyable -- not taxing or stressful -- game.  And continuing to add levels is just another considerate feature."}
{"label": 0, "data": "While 'Tapped Out' is fun to play because it steeps itself in Simpsons' lore, it still pushes hard to get you to use real-world money to buy fake 'donut' currency.  You're given your own tiny Springfield, and as you manage it and give its residents things to do, short side stories and tasks emerge that add more people and things for you to drop into the world.  It's fun that you can hook up with other friends and peek into their Springfields (and shamelessly grab a bit of cash from them once a day), but a lot of items can't be bought with cash and have to be purchased using donuts, which you can earn in painfully tiny amounts.  There's a push to get you to buy donuts, and it's suspiciously easy to accidentally tap the 'buy' button that spends donuts for you.  It also uses Electronic Arts' Origin DRM software, which means that not only do you have to set up an EA Origin account, but if it can't log you in (which happens fairly regularly for me), you can't play.  I was a long-time EA fan, but Origin and other DRM schemes broke my will--they won't get any more of my money, but it's a testament to how much fun Tapped Out is that I'm still willing to spend some time with an EA title.If you're a Simpsons fan and casual gamer, The Simpsons: Tapped Out will amuse and entertain you on a casual basis.  It's better when you can hook up with friends, but you should play it a bit first before deciding whether you want to spend any real money to buy your way up the ladder."}

The only way the color choice could make it difficult to play the game is with the yellow and gold blocks,  which is probably why people have been complaining that their matches aren't always disappearing ( though one of them contains glimmers of white, which could maybe help you to tell the difference).Other than that, to address the other concerns, the leaderboards do, in fact, work if you have an amazon gamecircle account. Finally, the controls are completely responsive and easy. Some people may just feel uncomfortable with these controls, but you can get used to it.

{"label": 0, "data": "I felt so excited when I saw this app, I am a big fan of the show and I love LeVar Burton. The concept for this app and its presentation is fantastic. The little islands and the art/music is cute. The little animated boy-helper shows how to use this app very clearly as he points to everything he discusses.This app seems to need some work or bug fixing. The amount of issues I encountered while experimenting with the app may bear noting.  I sat on the porch for an hour trying to get the app to work smoothly.The regular force closing is the main set-back. It tends to force crash very frequently. (Especially if you click on the orange \"subscribe\" button, bottom left.) I debated if I wanted to spend $20.00 for a six month period when I know our local library has ebooks I can download for free. I don't really have a problem with the subscription fee, because I love \"Reading Rainbow\" and trust its content to be suitable and engaging for my small person. For experiment purposes, I decided to attempt the 1-book option to get a feel for the program.The only books available had almost nothing to do with the interests I had selected for the child. Most of the islands had no books on them. I wondered if I purchased the app would books be on the lonely islands and relevant to my child's tastes? (Not a big deal about tastes other than the app states it promotes that aspect, I was just curious if the selections could be available.)I had 2 islands that had a large selection of books about animals. (I picked 'Princesses, Space, and Pirates'.) I also attempted to see if there were any changes in the islands selections by just inputting 1 interest, but alas, still a bunch of animals. There were no videos available, although it seemed like there was 2 selections on 2 islands. The books that were listed were not visible, but looked gray as though there had been some artifacting in the file download or - something. I could see a sliver of color at the top of each book.It literally took an hour to download a book. The app stated it was unable to do so a couple of times. No interruption in wi-fi settings. (Downloading a book from amazon's app-books takes, at least, a few minutes.)The icon for the book I picked never showed up on the selection screen in the Backpack section. It was just a blank space, so I clicked there, and we were able to view the book.The book isn't interactive except for the occasional tap to move objects. I have been spoiled by our book-apps where one can tap on words or pictures to hear them being said, and see the word itself pop out at the viewer. The quality of the narration provided was outstanding.The book itself was lovely and repetitive in a fun way. Unfortunately, because of the lack of the accustomed interactions in app-books, the child lost interest.My questions are regarding the subscription version of the app:*Are all the other islands still devoid of books?*Are videos available?We really would like to use this app!"}

Some of the topics lead to a media that is on the web, but a lot is built in.One of my favorite parts is the interactive Rosaries and Chaplets.

{"label": 0, "data": "First off, these style of games, called roguelikes, is a very special sub-genre of dungeon crawlers that focus on very particular game elements.  These type of games are NOT your typical, glossy RPG fare with purposely low res graphics and minimal to even no instructions whatsoever.*Addendum: Based on a recommendation by a commenter,  I downloaded and began playing another roguelike game calledPixel Dungeon... and frankly, it blows HACK, SLASH, LOOT out of the water in every ... single ... way.  I had originally given this game a far higher rating, as I do not normally allow pricing to affect rating (especially in specialized market niche games), but the far superior interface and overall design of PIXEL DUNGEON puts this one to utter shame.  Plus PIXLE DUNGEON is always free.  Holy Smokes!  I have reviewed PIXEL DUNGEON, and cannot recommend it more over this attempt.*-- OriginalMy very first introduction to RPGs in general was through ROGUE on the Commodore 64, and although I eventually left it for the vaster RPG games such as PHANTASIE I & II (and a subsequent fandom for SSI as a game company), I still have memories to this day of my best friend and I hot seat swapping on ROGUE after one of us died. HACK, SLASH, LOOT certainly gave me shivers of ye olde days of my youth. Be warned, this is not a modern sub-genre for players easily frustrated or expecting fairness.Although there is a Network Access Permission, there are no adware modules, no social networks, not even any developer libraries. If you tap the [?] button twice, you will be taken to the developer website's Help page. Not that it had any hidden helpful hints beyond the backup weapon swapping. It does play OFFLINE.The graphics and buttons are initially very tiny.  It does have a zoom function (the typical magnifier glass icons) and text on/off, so this could be of help to those playing on smaller screens. Four classes, six quests, procedurally randomized dungeons, and a \"Best Of\" counter of moves made, enemies killed, number of total deaths, and for the really good (or lucky), number of wins. The replay is infinite - or at least till you give up.My two small peeves:> A lack of an exit button, nor does the back-key work, so it does remain in memory until closed by the Android Memory Manager (or you force close it).> The movement/attack would have been better off using a arrow key interface instead of the touch-screen. It is rather easy to miss tap, even on my big screen tablet, if not careful.  In fact, the touch interface in general is rather poorly implemented.For those unfamiliar with general roguelike game characteristics, I have a video review up on my YouTube channel (link available under my Profile).The most recent \"polished\" roguelike I have played was CLASS OF HEROS on the PSP, but overall I have always been more of a traditional RPG gamer, so I cannot really get into the nuts and bolts in comparing HACK, SLASH, LOOT to others like it beyond simply saying this:This is going to be one of those games you either love or better off not downloading.

At first it is enjoyable but something peeps aren't being honest with U about is U have to have neighbors. Why? Because you will have goals that you need neighbors to give you parts for. The problem with this is many neighbors just want to ask for parts but they never went to help you. So if you're trying to build a stove it will take a long time. This was my experience even though I tipped and gifted daily. Also I came across this I used 199 Amazon coins to buy nine gems which in turn I used to buy a red Chinese dessert stove that was part of a goal. Well I was just about to cook on it when it disappeared. It's not in my storage it's not anywhere  now it tells me I have not made a transaction. Wth!! This game is as bad as any cooking Facebook game such as cafe world ,Caf&eacute; land, and many others that I have played. If you want to spend every day visiting which is tipping gifting and asking for crap then this is the game for you. All I wanted was a game that I could cook dishes but not necessarily have to have neighbors. I think most people just want a enjoyable cooking game they could cook at their convenience without having to have been the inconvenience of having neighbors. By personal experience half of my neighbors only wanted to ask for stuff but never wanted to help me when I needed it. This is also typical of the many cooking games on Facebook. Sure this game is cute and you can unlock dishes but the biggest Minus is the neighbor issue and the continual begging for parts you'll have to do. No thank you I have since deleted my caf&eacute; when I figured out this is what it was going to be like. It was not what I was looking for and it sure is not relaxing!!!!"}

When the puzzle is complete, the name is pronounced, and the individual letters rise up along the bottom of the screen, and are each spoken aloud when touched.The permissions are a bit much, but I have activated the  parental controls, so I only took half a star for them.  The other half star was because each letter in the alphabet does have it's own vocal sound when said alone, without modification by other letters, and while I do love a softly spoken English accent, I just cannot ignore the fact that the letter R kept being mispronoumced in some words.-- for example: Starfish (Stah-fish) and Tractor (Trac-tah).

{"label": 1, "data": "My husband and I first started with the free version of this App because we rarely pay money for any of our Apps, however after 2 weeks of using this every night we decided this is an App worth investing in. We found no fault in the free version but thought it would be worth the money for additional sounds. We use this App on the Kindle Fire HD and and love playing around with all the sound options. My husband has trouble sleeping, but since we have started using this App he says he now finds it a lot easier to fall back asleep when he wakes in the middle of the night. We had tried melatonin and other over the counter sleep medicine and this is the first thing he has said helps him sleep. My recommendation: start with the free version, if you find you are using it frequently and want to add the additional sound options, then buy the paid version. The only difference between the two are the additional sound selections.Pros:Good selection of sounds in both the free and the paid versions, but the paid has even more.Has a timer you can set to turn off when you choose if you don't want it on all night (we keep it on all night though so when my husband wakes up he can easily fall back asleep)You can create favorite sound combinations and save  for future use, even creating your own name for the sound combinations.You can adjust the sound options so you decide what sounds are more prominent.ConsSome sound options do not have a steady volume so if you are using it to sleep it can be distracting, however there are enough options that do have constant sounds, so we just don't use them.All in all-for sleeping aids this is by far our favorite App.  We have never used this App for meditation or with headphones, but for what we have used it for- it works great! Highly recommended!"}

{"label": 0, "data": "Unfortunately this app has a serious software flaw.  I asked it to take a photo and then I opened it the screen showed a framework of lines but no photo.  When I touched the menu button my tablet screen displayed 35 helping hands flickering and when I touched the screen it would change backgrounds. Finally my gallery would open up but 1/2 of the screen was flickering helping hands.  I had to exit the app and restart.  This is a serious software flaw and it is not acceptable for an APP to be released with this type of coding error.This is a full featured photograph editing tool that can be useful for many people if it worked smoothly.  I use Photoshop on the PC all the time and it is amazing what you can do to clean up photographs.  This app allows you to modify and save your photos after you have fixed any issue that you may see.  You can select an existing picture from a gallery, take a new photo or use the tutorial to learn how to use the app.The tutorial takes you to YouTube to view a video on using the app.  Whenever you are editing a photo the main menu button is the hand in the upper RH corner.  When opened you can rotate and select the tool you want to use.  If you want to close the menu then just tap the screen.  When you touch a tool to use its menu open in the lower LH corner or RH corner and it can also be rotated.  This concept is easy to use and very helpful.  This is a beautifully designed and implemented user's interface.  You can always show the original photo and compare it to the original.  The app also has a built in help button on the top of the screen.  The app keeps track of the changes you have made to the photo and you can also undo them or redo them.At the present time the app needs some software editing and repair before a proper release.  I was using this app on a Samsung Galaxy Tab 4 tablet.  I have to give it 2 stars for a good start but please fix the software issues.Permissions:* Take Photos and pictures* modify or delete the contents of your USB storage* full network access* View network connections* view WIFI connections* prevent tablet from sleepingThis App does contain Flurry Analytics and it can track your use of the software and the software's performance on your device."}

It has an attractive library and a reasonably straightforward system for importing files (although it took me a bit to find it). However, as some other reviewers have stated, it is extremely slow. You have to wait while it turns pages, wait for it to re-size the page you are on, wait for it to even re-load a portion of a page that you just scrolled away from and back to.I do enough waiting for internet pages to load, lol. I was looking for something more similar to Kindle that would turn the page when you ask it to. This, unfortunately, was not it.Another negative for me is the fact that the help link takes you online. As far as I saw, there is not a help file with the app. Since the interface was not very intuitive to me, this was a big deal.For those who are still looking, I ended up settling on Bluefire Reader, which I like much better."}

You begin with a bacteria and by wiping out humanity you unlock new plague types.  If you beat everything on &quot;Brutal&quot; mode, you unlock the neurax worm and 3 cheat modes.  You can buy the worm and cheats but it's more satisfying to earn them...which I have.  My high score is just under 70,000 with a virus.  Just a very intriguing...yes, morbid game but it is amazing!  Looking forward to new plagues and new games from Endemic.  Bottom line, if you have any interest in biology and like games, this is a no brainer.  If you are even mildly interested in science, you'll love it.  If you could care less about anything science or health related, I bet you'll still like it!  Disclaimer...while many 5 star &quot;gushing&quot; reviews are bogus...I assure you that I had no knowledge of this game until I ran across it here to my Kindle.  I have read an interview with the developer since and am even more impressed.  This is his first game.  He used friends an family to help with graphics and sound but he's a true entrepreneur and Endemic is a very.small company with this one game in their arsenal.  He wrote and published the game for Ios on his own but contracted with Miniclip to port the game to Android.  Apparently, it's harder to write games for Android...  This is why it's free for Jo's but a buck for Android...Miniclip has to get their share.  Still, this is worth 10 bucks for me."}

The game wanted to freeze just about every time I opened up a new location.  I had to shut down and restart my Kindle Fire 2nd gen. 4 or 5 times, but I hadn't lost any progress.This is a new brand for me.  Unless their prices go down, I'll pass them by in the future.

I don't like Facebook and all that stuff and I'm not willing to make one to simply play a game, of which should already have all the features because people pay for it (exception of in app purchases such as coins)I hope this is a simple problem of which they will fix soon. Other wise it will just be another temple run to me. Playing with other people made the game seem like it meant something if you won or lost, either way it was fun.Pros:-No glitches-Great graphics-No crashing-Awesome map with different terrain-moving objectsCons:-multiplayer removed for GameCircle-No character customization-you cannot select your district-Only a few districts (4,5,12)-No missions or goalsI love the Hunger Games in all its forms and for once there is a good game for that. Most of them seemed like rip offs with no proof that they didn't take three seconds to make. Loving the game:I will change my rating if they bring multiplayer to GameCircle users again.

It is so quick and easy to use. So I was happy to find this app for my Kindle Fire, because I assumed it would be an easy way for me to pin stuff to my boards while playing around with my Fire.I was wrong.First, the app didn&#8217;t recognize my login credentials on multiple tries. Even after finally getting it to recognize me, it would occasionally require me to sign in again (similar to if you have cookies deactivated on your desktop) just because I switched between my boards.Second, it freezes up a lot. It just stops responding and the only way to clear it is to turn the Kindle off and back on.Third, pinning is cumbersome. On the desktop, I can just click my &#8220;pin it&#8221; button on my toolbar and a pop up window opens that lets me select which board I want to pin to and add comments. Pinning anything through this app is a complicated mess. Combined with the constant having to sign-in because it doesn&#8217;t recognize my credentials, I just give up and don&#8217;t pin.Love the site. Hate the app."}

So it's more than an interface to its website.]Basically it is what the dev says: it is an Android interface to its website.  In order to use this app you pay for, you must create an account on the dev's website. This involves giving him your email address.  You MUST give it internet access to work!Since it really is only web-based, what happens to your data if he goes out of business, or his server isn't up to snuff?  The list goes on about why apps requiring a third-party server in order to function is so troubling.To top it off, it has/wants your Facebook. No thank you.The app itself is *very* buggy. Do *not* hit your back button on your phone or tablet!  The app can't handle that, though at least sometimes it does ask if you want to exit.The app seems interesting, and doesn't have any malware/adware except for the Facebook part, and it does prompt if you want to exit when you have hit BACK too many times.  For these reasons it gets a second star.Really, though, the app is still in Beta and relies on the developer's server.

I was surprised to find that it's quite fun.It starts out easy but by the 9th wave or so it was (at least for me) quite challenging. Early upgrades are easy enough to get, but soon become quite expensive. Fortunately even if you fail a level you still get a small amount of the points you accumulate to spend on the upgrades, so if you are stuck, often a few retries will get you to the point where you can get a helpful upgrade.I mistakenly used a couple of valuable resources too early in the game (charms and a revive) - save those for later when it gets difficult! The revive is really not important early on since the worst that happens if you die is you have to restart the level (I thought I'd have to start from the beginning). Trying to find a working strategy for some of these levels is quite fun.Gameplay is mostly smooth on my Fire - it does lag a bit when action gets heavy but still completely playable. It has exited unexpectedly a couple times but no big trouble.Yes, it's always prompting you to buy glu credits but that's easy enough to ignore. And while that may speed your path to upgrades, there's still lots of fun to be had without buying them (you can get a good number for free in gameplay).I had downrated the game because of some bugs, but glu support helped with my lost glu credits, and the current version works a lot better, so I've been able to finish the game and have restored my original rating."}

{"label": 1, "data": "What's not to like about this Scrabble knock off from Zynga?  If you enjoy playing that you'll enjoy this.However, what's not to like?  Well, when playing in front of someone using the physical board and tiles, you can't test out whether what you think is a word is actually a word or whether it works in the spot you want.  In Scrabble, you can be challenged on the authenticity of your word.  Online, you can test away with almost as much time as you need, free of a challenge from your competition.  And, I'm quite sure that many players are making use of anagram programs that suggest words based on the tiles on your rack.But, it is what it is and helps while away the time.I would rate higher if there were time limits for word placement that were in minutes instead of days.  I can't see how cheating -- use of anagram breakers -- can be prevented, unfortunately."}

{"label": 1, "data": "I have been a long time Sims fan and loved this newest app that became available. Set up to work on the Kindle Fire, The Sims Freeplay does allow you to play the Sims without having to purchase Simoleons or other items in the inapp store in the game. I have been playing this for about a year and have to say that with the updates the developer's keep providing I never get tired of the Sims and feel that it is much more fun than the Virtual Families 2 game available on Kindle Fire because of the constant updates and ability to change things up with your sims.Pros:1) Graphics are fantastic.2) You can redesign your houses and your Sims quite easily.3) You can now add stories to your homes and buy beachfront property.4) You can now go ice skating and have snowball fights and other snow related activities.5) You now have additional hobbies you can learn (ice skating and woodmaking).6) You now have additional careers available to your sims (movie star, real estate agent).7) You get more personal items that your Sims can use like stairs and weather related items (fans, heaters, wood stoves, etc.).8) You can now visit your neighbors towns (need to be logged into Facebook).9) There are now goals related to a mystery island that the sims can access.Cons1) I really wish that the Sims we have were set up like the video game Sims that once they learned the behavior you did not have tocheck on them all of the time. It is aggravating to make sure that they are fed, rested, etc. every day. You can put the game onpause but if you do that you have to work longer on making sure that your sims career levels and other activities get leveled up.The same issue with them not going off to their jobs without you going into the game and doing so for them. Since I don't havewifi access outside of the home I really cannot check in with my sims unless I am there so a lot of times I miss sending them towork and have to spend about 2 hours getting everyone back to good health when I do get home.2) You can only have up to 31 sims. So you are really stuck once you get to that point since you cannot add any new sims though theyallow you to keep purchasing homes.3) The preteen sims get boring after a while and I wish that there was a way to have the pre-teen sims grow up and get married ormove to another town, go to college, etc. to make it more interesting.4) Though the graphics are good sometimes when I have a sims home with multiple stories the graphics go fuzzy and then I can seeitems on the first floor through the second floor and my sims get stuck and cannot select anything.5) Some of the hobbies a year later are still taking forever to find all of the items (fashion designer and fishing).6) I really wish that those who have the beachfront homes then had access to an actual beach! It would be great, because you can thenhave beach competitions, have sims surfing, building sandcastles, tanning, etc. It just seems a waste of the Simoleons it costs topurchase those homes when really there is nothing that exciting about them except they are on a larger lot.I still recommend this as a fun app to play to pass the time with."}

It offers excellent customization, allowing more layers than any other app.  It has an option for users to record and submit their own sounds - there are over 1,000 sounds in the &quot;Recordings&quot; file alone above and beyond what are offered in the app itself.  Most of the sound files are of a suffcient length and variability that looping is hardly discernable.  Ambiance is an excellent background sound generator.So why am I docking Ambiance a quarter-star?  While I do use ambient sounds while reading or occasionally as an activity timer,  my main purpose is as a sleep aid.  I found Ambiance's controls a little less intuitive than one or two of my other sound apps.  That beind said, the Dev has a pretty nice website with support available, so that helps mitigate any difficulties with the learning curve.  Ambiance also tends to use up my battery quicker than other similarly purposed apps, so if I don't have it plugged into the charger I only use it for shorter periods of time.If you want a good sound generator application with a HUGE library of sounds to choose from, this is the app for that.

I wasn't quite sure what the highlighting on the keyboard at the top of the screen was about. It didn't change anything when I moved it up or down the scale in the Interval Training section. I liked the piano action and the sound. I was expecting something more along the lines of what we did for interval training in college music theory."}

Also, South Park has been taken off which made me really mad, and replaced all the good shows with cheesy Disney shows. Not that all Disney shows are bad but I would like a little more selection.

No iffy stuff (no worries for the young ones) and the problems are workable if you think hard.  No hidden object scenes which is a relief, although Big Fish has some gorgeous ones.  No flashy graphics, but it's a pleasant enough storyline and a nice way to spend a couple of hours.

I'll probably get tired of it in a month, but, by then, there will be another app to take its place.Nice bright colors, and you get a hint of where the ball will be coming from by watching for the burst of smoke.  I get the ball to where it's going each time I'm using my left control fan.  My right control fan is the problem:  My thumb gets tangled in my Kindle's pop-up, go-to-home bar each time I try to use that button on the right side.  But I've almost got that darn right thumb to behave and to hit the button exactly dead-on.  I respect Thom Bone and his reviews, but I think he's wrong this time:  I found it easy to gently manipulate the fan air.  Glad I didn't take the Thom Bone review to heart, and checked it out for myself.It has been several weeks since I've had the time to even think about downloading the FAOTD.

It is very frustrating to keep going back and forth and not have a streamline of where to go.

I finally discovered that pushing the back &#34;button&#34; twice quickly on my device  I could get to my music.

Any ICS compatible apps have always worked just fine.I give it 2 stars though just because I like the concept of file transfer between computers/devices without having to get help from a \"cloud\".  Usually I give apps that FC on me just 1 star.But from reading the reviews it seems this app provides a URL for another comptuer/device to use to download the pics/videos from the device.  I guess that overcomes any need to have the app on the other device or a PC client app in order to do file transfers.My personal favorite for file transfers via WiFi is X-Link, you can find it on the Android Market.  X-Link is always free.  You need to have the app on 2 devices, or the app on the device and a client PC program in order to do transfers, but its fast and easier than typing URLs.  The client PC program is a free Java program."}

{"label": 1, "data": "Picasso is a cute little drawing tool that reminds me of the crayon etchings we made in school.  Using crayons we would covered a piece of paper with colorful patterns, coated the paper in black wax so all the color was hidden, and then etched a picture into the black wax exposing the colored patterns beneath. Picasso is like a crayon etching only digital.Using the app you select a colorful, patterned background.  Once the background is selected the screen turns black and you use a finger to \"draw\" through the black coating revealing the colorful pattern underneath.  You can also select one of six pattern stamps (lips, hearts, stars, etc) to enhance your doodles.  This app is loads of fun for the pre and elementary school set.The only grumbles I have about the app is that it does not have a lot of options.  You can change the width of the brush or the size of the stamp, but that is about it.  It would be nice to have different brush styles like a spray-paint can or an angled wedge.  The patterns stamps are great but a must larger selection is needed.  The ability to rotate the pattern stamps is also a must.  But the biggest complaint about the app is that you can't change the background once you start your doodles.  Currently if you try to change the background you lose all your unsaved doodles and have to start over again.  It would be oh-so-nice if there was an option to change the background on the fly.So all-in-all a good solid app that will keep the kiddies entertained for hours."}

{"label": 1, "data": "I'm relatively new to the world of smart phones, and a complete newbie when it comes to tablet devices, but to date this is my favorite app. Sure, you could use your computer/tablet/phone to surf over to the NPR website, hunt around for these audio clips, download them to your computer, transfer them to your phone or tablet device, then organize them...or you could just download this free app, and there you go...done. It's all right there for you to browse at your leisure. Every show is broken down into category, title, date, and a description. It couldn't be easier. My only complaint is that it appears to lack a search function. Or maybe it doesn't and I'm just too inept to figure out how to use it. (Like I said...totally newbie at tablets here).Given the abundance of affordable tablet devices on the market these days, there's no longer an access barrier to the great culture (music, art, literature, poetry, food, etc) that this country has to offer. The NPR Life Culture Podcaster makes it just that much easier. People who don't use this app are making a conscious choice to remain willfully ignorant of said culture."}

{"label": 0, "data": "This game is obviously geared towards children but it's far too repetitive in my opinion.  There is absolutely no skill required, only a lot of tapping &amp; swiping but the touch recognition is quite lacking making this game frustrating.Basically, you are a volunteer at an animal rescue.  You have to visit each animal &amp; answer a health question on new animals.  Each animal has to be fed twice unless the vet says otherwise, their cage or lotteries cleaned, &amp; watered.  Some animals can be given treats, brushed, let outside, &amp; given toys while outside, which you're suppose to be able to move the toys with your finger as they play with it but it rarely worked for me.  The water is at a well &amp; everything else is in the storage shed.  You have to add the items to your inventory that has 6 slots but 1 will automatically be taken up by trash when you clean the cages so you have to leave one open.  Once done you have to return everything where you got it before ending your day or adding other things.  While taking care if the animals people come by looking for a new pet.  Some are specific about what they want while others aren't &amp; even if they say any animal it doesn't let you adopt out any animal.  As well, for me, the stats made but sense so I had to try every animal until 1 was OK to be adopted.  What looked happy &amp; healthy apparently isn't so that was confusing &amp; time consuming.  Before leaving you have to make sure all the animals are locked in their pen &amp; inventory is put away including dumping your trash in the dumpster.  You have to be done by 4pm &amp; tap the gate to end your day.  When you come back the next morning there will be new animals &amp; you start all over again.  All the new animals have to be &quot;examined&quot; which is that you are told a health problem &amp; chose the best action out of 3, which don't always make sense &amp; seems like it would be difficult for younger kids, especially how long the questions &amp; answer choices are.  I didn't see that wrong answers hurt your game play &amp; it let's you keep selecting until you have the right one.The graphics are very nice but the positioning of the screen is a pain most of the time making unused areas block the places I am trying to tap.  As you complete adoptions &amp; goals you get stars that you can spend on extra decorations for the shelter.  The items are boring &amp; you cannot move them around.  As you scroll through the items for sale they are shown in the locations where they will be placed.This game is far from worth $4!  There are plenty of free pet rescue games on the market that are way more interactive &amp; eenjoyable for all ages.  There are no surprises or anything to work to or really earn.  I recommended everyone still try it if this might be a game you like because this is just my opinion."}

{"label": 1, "data": "This is a good game with great graphics, spoken dialogue, and an engaging plot: in short, all you'd ask for from a good RPG. It plays a lot like Final Fantasy and the likes, with a 'fragment' system that lets you change characters' skills and an active battle gauge. There's some cool loot, many varied zones, interesting bosses, and unique characters.One minor complaint is the game is a bit on the easy side, especially if you're a FF veteran. Unless you do your level best to avoid all random battles (which is possible, by either carefully dodging the patrolling mobs or bypassing chests) you should have no problem whatsoever beating down everything in your path. You don't even really need a healer since potions are so plentiful and powerful, and in regular gameplay you often level up so frequently that you really don't need to pop even those. However, I don't really care much about difficulty in these types of games. I'm far more interested in the roleplay aspect, and that is pretty strong in Eternal Legacy. You actually care about the characters and their quest, and it's an exciting plot with some pretty major twists.Technically the game is pretty solid- it runs flawlessly on 1st gen Kindle Fire HD and loads very quickly- astonishingly so, in fact, considering how slowly some other games with lesser graphics load. I did once fall through the floor of the world, which was kind of bad since it only autosaves when you transition areas, but other than that there were no problems. You can save manually by visiting a save point, just like in most FF games.Area, enemy, and ability graphics are all well done. So is the combat flow which does a good job of not getting in your way. You can chose to control one character and let the other two run with AI, or can control all three if you prefer. There is a good size roster of characters available which some pretty unique moves, and it's fun to try them all out. Most gear aside from weapons is bought, not found, and money is simply not an issue so you pretty much walk around geared out. The interesting finds are fragments that boost your abilities or add new skills. At certain levels the characters also learn new ultimate moves, some of which are pretty spectacular.That said, although the abilities, summons, and moves are cool looking, they're often just not worth using. They usually take a lot of time and all are capped at the all-too-familiar 9999 hit. Some abilities hit multiple times, and these are the only ones worth using. The best attacks are actually just normal attacks with the right fragments equipped. For example, there's a fragment that lets you immediately attack, another that attacks twice per move, and another that retaliates. Stick all three and a few crit/attack power ones on a single character and they can easily do over 40k damage in a single attack- and they'll be doing it at the start and every time they get hit. That's more than any spell can possibly do, and it costs no mana. So yeah, there's some things that probably could use a bit of balancing.The biggest criticism I have though, is that the game is simply not that long. You will likely be astonished when you hit the end, as it's very abrupt- a brief cutscene and you're back on the main menu, most likely scratching your head and asking 'is that it?' I felt like I was just getting into the game when it ended; it is very significantly shorter than most classic JRPGs and even some Android ones like Chaos Rings.So on that note- great game, worth what you pay for it, but wish there was either a sequel or more play time."}

As a freebie, it will amuse you for a while if your demands aren't too high.Additional info a week later:  It is possible to achieve more levels without paying for them.

I like that it stacks the cards automatically for you even when you uncover them.  What I think is missing is that the cards are difficult to manually stack (what happen to the double click that other games have) also when an ace is uncovered at the beginning of the game it doesn't automatically get stacked.

{"label": 0, "data": "...such a shame considering how well designed this version of Sudoku actually is. Of the other \"free\" Sudoku games I've downloaded, this one excels in every way. It has a great interface with easy to use buttons (erase, insert numbers, insert a \"note\" or placeholder numbers) and the game board has a great look to it. The only thing lacking  in the design is that the banner ad across the top of the screen seems to be covering something game related. Can't tell for sure, by  it looks like there is something under it.Unfortunately, whenever an ad \"pops\" over the screen (full-page ad basically covers the entire screen) the game stops functioning. The ad supported game is not a big deal. I can easily tolerate ads for a good game, but after you close the ad, the game goes blank on a black screen. You can not get the game  to start again (just a black screen) until you reboot.Maybe this game is not stable on the Kindle Fire HD. I'll try it again in a few weeks and see if they've developed it further. It's too bad, really. I like this version a lot but I've uninstalled since it seems unplayable for now.I do recommend you give it a try.Great game if it works for you! I started on Medium difficulty (since I do Sudoku a lot) and it was fun and challenging. I love that there are no \"glowing\" tiles or other features that \"help\" during the game. I like to be challenged by puzzle games, so those features are not fun for me. Cleared three levels before the freezing frustrated me enough to uninstall, but it looked like it had plenty of levels left!"}

Interesting atmospheric worlds with very clear background boundaries and interesting use of physics + auto-scrolling.You tap onto the screen to have your character / characters fly upward, and let go to drop them back down.  Being mid-flight causes the characters to accelerate to the right side of the screen, which becomes your &#34;sweet spot&#34; when trying to speed-run levels.  There are &#34;make your character / characters larger&#34; collectibles, and similar ones that shrink your size.  You need to use these, in conjunction to flying properly, to make it through automatically scrolling background obstacles.It sounds simple, but the huge number of stages, the variety between stages, and the aesthetic go a long way in making it feel fresh the whole way through.  It gets pretty difficult too - and never that &#34;I'm not having any fun right now&#34; difficulty.  Get it!  It's still free :)"}

The scrolling bar to feed the animals has also improved, it's tighter and easier to control, not bouncing all over the place.Now if the developers can include updating to the neighbors/friends list and give you the ability to delete unwanted members that were added only to satisfy a goal this game would get the 5 stars it deserves.Fun and addicting.You raise and feed animals. Also crossbreed them to create new ones. Definitely worth 5 stars if the game didn't have so many problems.First,  play for an hour and expect the game to crash 5 or more times. I have a high speed connection for streaming live baseball but the streaming in this game is very jerky. This is important as one of the things to do is feed the animals. You do this by sliding a bar to select the proper food. Sometimes you just can 't move it or it bounces. You fail as time runs out. The neighbor system makes no sense. You add a friend but it never gets updated. So my daughter is forever at level 8 and I can't see her improvements. Many goals require you to add to your neighbor list but there's no way to delete them so your list of useless characters just grows."}

So far what we've played is the book portion, where they show a dinosaur for each letter, and read one to two sentences written below to describe it. The dinosaur names are huge and/or tricky to read! But he's having fun reading the smaller words. :)  You can tap one a word to hear it said, like the Oceanhouse Media books, and since it is about dinosaurs it catches many boys' (and some girls') attentions. My son is not yet totally captivated by the Dinosaur Train show on PBS, so I'm glad and surprised he likes this app. I think he will get several years use from this app, given the big word verbiage on the description pages. These pages also included buttons to press to see the dinosaur in full color and then in bones only, see if it eats plants or is a carnivore, and have the words read. There seems to be a lot more to this app, but we've yet to try it all out yet.I can see this app being best for ages 4-9, given lots of teachable moments of word pronunciation, bone structure, diets (who eats what, why, where), how their structure differs based on diet - I.e. strong legs, long neck, armour, etc., time periods in history such as the Cretaceous Period, what colors you think they might have looked like and why based on where they lived (I.e. water, fields, trees), etc. So far I would describe this as the best &amp; most interactive dinosaur book that will keep your child's attention more than a static paper book, without being so interactive that it removes the imagination you get from a book.I highly recommend this app!"}

{"label": 0, "data": "Or at least, that's how it comes across.  I LOVE games of this type.  Point/click adventure/exploration/puzzle types games are among my very favorites.  This one is just plain bad, though.One star deducted for terrible grammar and usage in the text portions of the game.  Non-English developer?  Fine, but hire a decent translator.  If the dev is actually an English speaker, there's absolutely no excuse for the awfulness.Another star deducted for overall lameness.  The \"mystery\" is silly, and the clues left by the various servants in the form of journal entries sound like they're directed at eight-year-olds.  Also, there wasn't much to look at.  The better games of this type will have several things per screen to say to the player, even if just for \"color\".  This game is very bare.A third star deducted, because the game is ridiculously, outrageously short.  It would barely make a decent free teaser for the much much longer game games like this SHOULD be.The Mystery of the Crimson Manor probably really only deserves one star, instead of two, but I leave it at two partly because I love the genre so much in general, and partly because I don't want to be in the group of one-star raters who aren't rating the game itself (rather that they couldn't download it) and the ones who couldn't seem to find the very obvious \"Save and Exit\" button at the bottom right side of the screen.Nonetheless, I'll be avoiding games by Mediacity Games from now on, if this one is an example of what I'm likely to get from that developer."}

The control circle is either not responsive to get your character to move or you have to press higher up on the screen above the Control Icon displayed in order to get your character to even move. The menu settings shows that you can change the screens touch response higher or lower but the option bar is greyed out and you can not change the sensitivity. This might have solved the issue of playing the game moving my character but I can not since that option on the menu screen is greyed out and not accessible.

Gotcha.I understand the weather app using GPS tracking; that makes sense.  However, I have a few questions regarding permissions and IAP (as reported in the description) that need answering, and based on previous comments by the dev/producer I know he's responsive.MR. PULKKA:-- Question #1: When the FAOTD launched, this app included the ability to spy on its customers through the permission which reported running apps and recently run apps.  This was changed within a couple of hours.  Do you promise that permission will never be included in a future version?-- Question #2: Why do you have IN-APP PURCHASING in an application targeting children?(By the way, for those folks who are not aware, In-App Purchasing uses your credit card on file with Amazon to allow the developer to charge you money inside an application, AND it is turned ON by default in the Amazon App Store application.)Given the responsiveness of Mr. Pulkka in previous reviews, as well as the \"emergency\" updating of the version to remove the heinous spying permission, I'm willing to give him the benefit of the doubt which is why I have three stars right now.  I'm willing to reconsider the star count based on his response.  Stay tuned."}

Version 1.78 is available at Google Play Store, but only version 1.76 is available here. The author states, on his site, that the reason that the Amazon store is so far behind is all the rules that he is required to follow to publish an upgrade.PLEASE, Amazon, give us the ability to have a BETA version in the store for a product that has been previously approved, a version that we can download, knowing that it has not yet been fully vetted by Amazon, then once they have vetted the program according to all your rules, they can publish the final version for that version number.I'd love to get version 1.78, but for some reason, Google Play wants to put it on my phone, not on my Kindle.John"}

But with the value of the dollar in bowling, Polar Bowler has been one of those go to games that had been worth it for the computer. But with people demanding more from tablets, many people have felt that bowling games had lost their way. Unfortunately for WildTangent, trying to make a new version of Polar Bowler, it is a new challenge that doesn't feel like it is invigorating, and instead loses it heart on the frames. Here, trying to change it into a Angry Birds style of a game, causes a lot of the fun to go out on strike. Instead, you have to knock down as many pins through a open world frame as possible to advance to the next level. sadly, I fund this to be less fun in value and challenge. I would honestly recommend you get Polar Bowler 1st Frame for the value.Graphics: BSound: C+Control: B-Fun & Enjoyment: C-Overall: C 1/2+"}

I like that Amazon does the research of all those apps and presents some to me that it thinks I might be interested in and I have a choice to accept or not!I do not have time to go looking into all those apps so it is nice to just recieve an email telling me of the FREE app of the day in my email box and then I can put it on my device if I want to try it."}

{"label": 1, "data": "I remember as a teen in the 80s owning these Citizen watches that looked like they belonged embedded in the Space Shuttle's console.  Telling time was just not enough.  No, it had to have twirly bits, flashing lights, bar graphs, and all manner of tiny, incomprehensible numbers.  If you have a weakness for such displays (I admit I still do),  then WIFI OVERVIEW 360 PRO is the foo-foo version of your tablet's plain-jane Wi Fi display.*A word about the Fine GPS permission:  I checked 3 different security applications and data usage over Wi Fi (tablet, Verizon Jetpack overwatch, and Malwarebytes privacy settings along with AVG network data monitor), and this app does NOT have GPS Tracking on as default.  In the app, there is a Wi Fi Sniffer feature that locate networks to varying degrees of sensitivity,  which also requires the user to manually turn on the GPS locator.  Much like Google Maps that lets you to determine sensitivity of position or none at all, this app lets you do the same.In discussion with other reviewers, all credit due to jjceo (tip of the hat to you), it is fairly determined that the Fine GPS permission is excessive,  even in various international circumstances where one would need it (or in a signal-busy metro downtown area I was imagining), that if the developer wishes to save an otherwise decent app, it does need to be directly addressed/removed altogether, yet it IS still optional.Another Important Note: Under the SETTINGS menu, first option, \"When leaving, let Wi Fi on?\" is toggled on by default, causing the app to continue to run, and thereby overriding your device Wi Fi settings  For many, this is desirable, for others, not so good.  Aside from the fact \"let\" should probably be \"leave\", automatic overides set as a default is tricky business for any app that doesn't have full documentation and/or doesn't point out up front there are automatic protocols enabled.*Won't even go into the other permissions, but each one (save Fine GPS as explained above) is as expected to make this app work.  Every single morning, I scan each and every FAOTD with AVG's full suite as well as a dedicated malware scanner, and this one is OKAY in spite of older reviews.The display itself has those same nostalgic tiny number arrays as did my old navigator watches, even on a 10.1\" screen, which may be a problem on 7\" or less screen sizes.  The developer should really include a font pt selector in the settings.  This is the only -1 Star Hit.  However, it does switch between Landscape and Portrait orientation,  leaving alot of open screen space, so this feature may make it workable for large screen phones. Or you may want to carry an Oxford Compact Dictionary magnifier monocle with you.As for information,  it really does break down the numbers, although between my own tablet's Wi Fi selector and my online maintenance watchdog (Verizon Jetpack), WI FI OVERVIEW doesn't really give me much extra.  However,  I do like the frequency info for each network- I have been having trouble with a bluetooth speaker causing degrading throughput,  and now I will be able to check to see if it is frequency bleed (just have to find that speaker first).All in all, if you like details, or at least impressing the snot out of nearby observers when you open up this app to check for local hotspots, WI FI OVERVIEW 360 PRO certainly has the goods and that classic \"Dunno wot it means, but sure looks fancy\" vibe I used to love in my watches."}

I think the training program is effective - it's easy enough to get a beginner started, and challenging enough that you should see improvement fairly quickly.  I also like that the program does check off the completed runs, so you can see how far you've come. I have only had a few minor problems.  First, I've had the app stop unexpectedly a couple of times.  It may just be incompatibility with some of my other apps, but it's frustrating when you're halfway through a run and you lose the trainer cues.  If there was a way to restart and then go directly to a point midway through a run, I'd call it a 5-star app.  Unfortunately, the only way to get to a point ten minutes in, is to let the app run for ten minutes... and that's not going to happen right in the middle of a workout.

{"label": 0, "data": "I took away one star because of how hard it is to type in a letter(you have to hold your hand down longer than you would for the normal kindle fire keyboard).  I took aways the second star because of how dependant the game is on other people, for instance, instead of allowing you to get a second chance to put in what you think is a better answer than your last, for the fast money round, it makes you ask your friends on facebook, or ask a friend by email(not many people know their friends emails), or it gives you the choice to text someone you know, and ask them to try the fast money round (but on many devices, such as the kindle fire, you cannot text people, (unless, of course, you have an app that allows you to) which as you would amagine is a problem.  Also, some people may not have facebook, therefor those people will not be able to ask people from facebook to help out.  I did not take a star for this, because I feel that it is not to much of an issue, but whenever you ask friends from facebook to help you out, it shows all of your facebook friends and if you have hundreds of friends on facebook (like most facebookers do), then you may find it hard to select the few friends that actually play family fued.

Some of the silhouettes were tricky but most of them were pretty quick to find, which made me feel pretty clever when I racked up a bunch in a few seconds. I do wish the free trial included more than two crew members but hey, it was free.The treasured item mechanic, however, fell a bit short for me: once you clear a handful of normal hidden objects, you use the crystal ball to search for a ghostly treasured item. This really amounts just to dragging the orb view around the screen waiting for flames to light up and something to be selected, though. It didn't feel very puzzly or even hidden at all. And I was having just enough UI lag to make the dragging operation register as a bunch of failed taps, which lost me lots of points.The story felt a bit thin, but that might get better in the paid levels. The graphics are lovely and fit the feel of the story very well. I don't actually remembers the music which probably means it was pleasant and unobtrusive.Overall recommendation: Grab it for free and see if you like the extra mechanics enough to pay for more levels. I didn't, but it was close, and you might."}

{"label": 0, "data": "Like so many programs out there today, the food database makes little or no sense. Foods are always based on volume even when they should be based on weight. Entering values that can be easily adjusted for later use is a pain (e.g. entering 10 grams and wanting 11 grams the next time because it assumes you are entering a &#34;portion&#34; size). Creating recipes is not bad -- editing them is terrible unless you are on the PC. Basically, the PC version is OK, but the tablet version LEAVES a lot to be desired."}
{"label": 1, "data": "I grabbed this game for the 99 cent promo price and am glad that I did. My son is only 2 and barely able to play just 2 of the games, but there is a lot of good content here that will grow with him.There are 10 games total, half relating to mathmatics and half to language. There are no bad games, but some are more interesting then others. I like the pattern and ordering games the best. My son is able to do the ordering game on the lowest level and the spelling game on the 3 letter setting and likes the word bingo, but needs a little verbal coaching to pick out the correct word.In Patterns there is a sequence of shapes and/or pictures and the child is asked to pick which one comes next. This sort of thing is usually very fun for kids around this age.In ordering the goal is to touch the balloons in the correct order, such as alphabetical, biggest to smallest, etc. My son really enjoys this on level 1.Advanced counting works just like the Kintergarten and Preschool apps counting, but rather than counting by ones, it asks the child to count by 2's, 3's, 5's and 10's. I wish this game had a difficulty selector that would determine total number of balls on the screen at once to help with learning the concept on smaller numbers. I would prefer if larger numbers over 100 did not include the word and, they no longer say one hundred and one, they now just say one hundred one.Fractions is a nice visual game where the child is asked to find the picture that represents the stated fraction, such as a pie with 2 of four pieces shaded for 2/4ths. I would like to see a choice on this one to have the answers remain stationary for children with visual tracking difficulties.The addtion and Subtraction is much like that in the Kindergarten and Preschool app, but goes to much higher numbers, my son is also getting the hang of addition only for the smaller numbers.Word bingo is a fun concept, kid's this age always love bingo. The main problem I had here was related to volume, some words were hard to hear even at max volume (in fact the whole game is pretty quiet at max volume). I'm not sure I like the way that the word switches if you get one wrong, I think it would be best to let the child guess again until they get the right answer. I would also like to see the word written on the tile with the picture after the tile is flipped to strenthen the association.Compound words seems like the sort of game I would have enjoyed as a child. The goal is just to match two parts of compound words together, such as cat and nip to make catnip. I got one wrong myself, apparently backlight wasn't the compound word the game was looking for.Contractions is simply choosing the contraction such as can't and matching it with the full meaning can not. Pretty straightforward.Verbs, Nouns, and Adjectives is just like Fractions in that the answers float around and you have to pick out the right answer. I would like to see a choice to have the answers remain stationary on this one as well.Overall there are a lot of good games included in this collection that cover quite a few areas of first grade education. I would like to see more apps covering subjects other than just reading and math, but this game at least covers a variety of reading and math related activities. It would also be nice if rather than gush constant praise the game would go with a simple correct or yes every once in a while. I am happy with my purchase and would recommend this game to children in the target range."}

In this type of game the jump button should be just a single dedicated jump button.  The jump-left, jump-up, jump-right combo has killed me more often than anything else.  I run left and accidentally hit the jump-right, when I was trying for the up, jumps me right back into a monster I was running away from.  Thanks devs for the suicide.  Too annoying to play.

{"label": 1, "data": "Greedy Spiders 2 is a cute game and is quite challenging as you get into higher levels. The graphics are nice and works perfectly on Kindle fire.The controls are simple to use and there is total of 144 levels for fun. As you start playing you will notice that this is more of a \"strategy\" based game more or less likeBurn The Rope +. There can be situations wherein you may have to freeze spiders as they work in a team to trap you. I personally hate spiders so virtually I feel better when I win. It is child friendly game and if your child loves to play with bugs and spiders this game will definitely keep them engaged for a long time.The game does have access to internet and shows video via you-tube, The permissions need full internet access and view the network state.It is good game nonetheless. Worthy of 99C!Have fun!"}

Not too hard as to be frustrating but not so easy as to be boring.  I usually enjoy a story laden adventure but for some reason these &quot; Magicians&quot; like to chat. I know you can click it faster but then you miss the gist. When 3 is pleanty why use 10..... nuff said?

I think it is still trying to finish that. crashed and need to hard stop the app. The dev should test this experience more.The opening picture was beautiful shot of an egret. the menu interface is plain which was mentioned in another review. more like yhe demo-maker menus made it to production.With the required account, no terms of use to help me understand who is mining personal data and sharing it how, and the ease to crash, i give it two stars for poor privacy protection and low quality from the crash."}

{"label": 0, "data": "It always seems the bigger the software company the more they think that it OK for them to take your personal data or to charge you more and more for a game using In App Purchases. This is a cute game with good graphics and it is fairly easy to play but you should know what else is in the game.This game is just loaded to take as much data from you as possible. It contains Flurry Analytics that scans your device and transmits data to the developer. Its power to take data is enhanced by the permissions you accepted into your device when you said yes, please install the game.This app is just a gold mine of data collecting permissions and software code. There is also a lot of In App Purchases (IAP) that can cost you a lot of real money!  The app contains the following questionable items:* Amazon in app billing* Google in app billing* Samsung in app billing* Users should be wary of games with in app billing as they can be expensive.  Developers tend to make the game become difficult to play very quickly to encourage you to purchase in app power-ups with real money.  This game features IAPs from $0.99 to $28.99 to buy 120,000 rings.  You can also unlock everything for a mere $20.99.* Flurry Analytics which collects and sends data to the developer's servers like your game play, behavioral data and usage patterns. It can also collect and send data based on the permissions the app has and that you have already approved to allow it to use.* Urban Airship is installed to send you a push notification from the developer and they may include an item you do not want. This is also included in a game that wants to sell you In-App-Purchases.Here is a list of permissions that can be used to be invasive!* Android permission internet* Read phone state* Get accounts* Write to external storage* Android vendor billing* Broadcast sticky* Receive boot completed so the app knows when your device is running* Read external storageJust remember that if you also accept an app update that is the same as downloading the app for the first time and you may also be accepting new permissions.  Make sure to review any app changes before downloading the update.Android operating systems are designed to be a closed box so that your information is private unless the app asks to use the information by requesting an Android permission and you accept the app and allow them to use it. Your only method of protecting yourself is to look at the requested permissions and decide if the game or app is worthwhile and if the permissions make sense for the app's use.  If you don't trust the permissions or the developer then do not download the app."}

{"label": 1, "data": "I have been playing this game for a month now. It's a cute entertaining game. It does want you to give Facebook info to solicit friends to help you get more votes in the game. It costs a lot and I mean A LOT to buy cute things like clothes and jewelry and if you spend real money for diamonds it's a big chunk of cash for a small amount of diamonds. You can still play and have fun without spending real monies but it will just take you a lot of time to get the diamonds you need. I only have 405 diamond's (in one month) and the dress I want is 900+! I WOULD NOT recommend this game for young children because it has some inappropriate clothes and content such ad flirting at a bar. The game does tend to glitch a lot and I can't purchase the .99 promotions. It always says there is a problem with amazon purchase.  If you need a friend in the game please feel free to add me YQDJ5.UPDATE: Got up to level 43 they did an update and I lost everything! I emailed customer service and after a week they gave me back SOME coins and diamonds but had to restart from level 3. They told me they would put me back to the level I was but this has not happened. STILL can't purchase the .99 promotions and items are even more expensive now. Not sure how long I will keep playing. Contests are also rigged the top winners (a little Bird told me) are almost always employees."}

I have had to uninstall/reinstall this app more times than I can recall now, since April, due to constant crashing; being unable to upload pictures; being unable to type a status; being unable to share posts/stories/etc; and having to attempt to post statuses five and six times, before it finally posting. I've now uninstalled/reinstalled it three times again tonight...and the app won't even open at this point. I try to open it, it goes to the page as though it's going to take me to the log in page, and then it crashes and takes me back to my Kindle carousel. I'm tired of fighting with it. I'll access FB via the web on my Kindle...I can deal with the minor inconvenience of not having the little &quot;easy button&quot; of an icon to touch.

I don't want to knock it down too much for that, as your mileage may vary, but I wanted to make it known.Beyond that, this is a pretty obvious clone of Tiny Wings. Mechanically it's just okay, and it features some oddities that make it not feel as good in motion as Tiny Wings does--for example, your donut dude can roll backwards, which is very off-putting and generally results in a quick death.Style wise, it definitely lacks the charm of Tiny Wings. The art works but it's nothing to write home about. The environments are fairly generic but they're functional.Overall, assuming the game works on your device, it's not the worst game Amazon has ever offered for free. If you've never played Tiny Wings a lot of the complaints I've mentioned probably won't seem as glaring, but if you have the basis for comparison like I do it's difficult to get past the fact that this is clearly an inferior game.3 out of 5 stars for working (possibly)  but being wholly unremarkable."}

{"label": 1, "data": "Over 20 years ago, I lived in Italy for 4 years (not consecutive) and had several group lessons but despite the efforts of my various instructors, I just didn't have the patience to learn the grammar.  My knowledge of vocabulary was good enough for me to communicate and function but I never could get the hang of conjugating verbs, learning about the articles, and spelling words properly.  Later lived in Latin America for 4 years and that messed up my language skills big time!  So, now I speak both languages very poorly - just throwing out words to make a mishmash sentence.  A couple years ago I went back to Italy and they asked me if I could speak english because they couldn't tell if I spoke Spanish, Italian or some unknown language!  (Note: My native language is American English)So, I'm returning to Italy again for a 2 week vacation and I'm determined to be better this time and not embarrass myself.  So, I got Duolingo on Feb 20th and believe it or not, I'm truly addicted to the program!  I have a full time job and when I come home I'm tired and yet, every single day, I spend 1 hour to 2 hours working on these mini lessons from Duolingo!  Funny, they are kind of addictive.  They force you to learn the language by making you hear the language, speak the language, interpret the phrase back and forth between languages, to spell it properly, and put it in the correct order.  If you do it wrong more than 3x then, it kicks you out of the lesson and makes you start over, but the lesson is different the next time around.  Now, you would think one would get discouraged, I mean, I've had to redo some lessons about 6x, and yet, somehow, the way it is structured, it makes me want to keep at it and do it right!  I mean it is working on me, one of the most stubborn learners!So there are a multitude of topics at every level (beginning/intermediate/advanced) and within each topic they have 4-8 different minilessons in each topic.  It visually has a graph that shows you where you are at.  And, even when you think you are done with a topic (whew), every couple of days, that topic reopens and they make you practice it again so you don't forget!  Wow!  So, even with my background knowledge/vocabulary of Italian, I'm still at the very end of the beginners (Level 8; 335 words!) and I've been working hard for a month!  Oh, another downer is I was working on it for 12 days and suddenly it reset and told me I was back on day 1.  I thought it did that every 12 days but now it says I'm at 16 days. (IF ANYONE READS THIS FROM DUOLINGO; I WANT IT RESET TO FEB 20TH THAT I'VE DONE IT EVERY SINGLE DAY!).The downside is that if you have never ever studied a latin language this would be super hard for you.  I think if you already know a similar language like spanish and how it is structured, it will be easier for you.  However, if you are a person who has never studied a romance language and absolute beginner that only knows Ciao, etc..and hever had a lesson, then, you will have a hard time.  Also, if you are a miserable speller in your native language, learning to spell Italian will kill you because it is so difficult to get all of the vowels in the right place.  I have many times translated a very complicated sentence from english to Italian, only to get it counted wrong cuz I misspelled 1 letter!  But, it forces me to really think what I'm writing and how it all comes together to form a complete sentence.  Also, it really doesn't teach you the vocabulary or the grammar rules, at all.  I kept failing the lesson because I wasn't sure what some articles meant because they seem to mean different things at different times.  Yesterday, I finally broke down and got a grammar book so I can look up what all of the articles mean.  So, this program works for people who are already familiar.  I'm worried that when I get in the more immediate level, I might need to study before using this as it isn't really a good teacher - doesn't explain or introduce new concepts.  Good for people that really want to tighten up what they already know and go farther."}

{"label": 1, "data": "If you like Mahjong is a good one. Remember that this is the FREE version..  There is a lot of play, so you can make the decision if you want to buy the extended version. There are actually 2 different. Artifacts 1 and Artifacts 2There is a bit of customizing you can do. There are five different tile sets and several backgrounds to choose from.  Also there is the Adventure Mahjong and the Classic version.The tile sets include the standard Mahjong tiles and I think that there are four other sets that all have nice artwork. This game is one of the collection of \"G5\" games. There are several others on my computer and I also bought some other titles for my Fire that I also have on my computer. The graphics are really good and unlike a couple of other Making games that I also got for my Fire, this one doesn't feel cheap.The screen is. a pretty good size screen, on the Fire, but there is an auto. zoom feature that you can turn on and off.Finally, if you have an android cell phone, you can put any of the apps you got for your Kindle Fire, on your cell phone too at no extra cost. You just go into Amazon's \"Manage My Kindle,\" and follow directions.  When I bought the full Artifact Game 1 it cost $4.99, but I think it is worth it. These G 5 games are adapted well to the smaller screens.I hope this review is helpful."}

{"label": 1, "data": "Game play:The object of the game is to tap your finger on the screen to avoid various hazards and swim as far as possible while collecting yellow dots and stars. You will have to avoid pollution, sharks, stinging jellyfish, foaming barrels of pollution and balls of spikes. All of these can end your level of play and send you back home.You do get power upgrades and you swim though them so they activate for a few seconds. The third time I opened the game it asked me to upgrade the power-up by touching the up-grade button. It is possible to buy the powerups which basically extend the time duration that the powerups last. You can buy these with the money you earn in the game. You won't see the powerups price unless you have earned enough money to buy it.The list of powerups is shown below. You can also upgrade your fish with the dollars you can earn but you need lots of money for some of them. The first upgrade starts at $500 and they go as high as $20,000. I was able to quickly earn money and buy multiple fish in the game.Home Screen:* Pop up news from the developer.* A row of fish you get to buy and the first one is $100 and you have $100 to start with.* Goals - a list of objectives to accomplish in the game* Upgrade - a list of current in game powerups which are speedy boost, focus boost and mega magic coral. Very quickly a magnet appeared so that you can quickly draw coral to you as you swim.* Menu - stats, news, credits, and audio. There is also a team happy face button where you can enter a code to unlock your fish. This feature never activated during my game playing.What I like:Game play is easy and fun. You simply touch the screen buy tapping on it to make the fish swim higher in the water. The graphics are good and the music and sound are also done well. That part of the game is nicely done and the controls work very well.After you swim for quite a while, some of the areas that you have to swim through get tighter and it gets harder. That is where some of the challenge comes from. I also like that the game keeps a list of the status you have achieved like coral saved, most coral saved, mega coral saved, speed bonus, focuses, longest swim, total distance swam, total belly ups, deaths by coral, deaths by shark, and deaths by mines.What I don't like:The app starts with a pop up news flash from the developer that covers the center of the screen every time you turn on the game that takes you or your children to their web site. After playing the game multiple times and starting it up multiple times this screen no longer appeared. Perhaps there was no news to advise me of since I had already looked at it.Fake reviews by the developers on this game and other games they have released. There is also a friend button that can show you the scores of your friends on this game. What I don't like is that it doesn't work and it makes me wonder what else has been disabled for this FAOTD.On other game platforms featuring this same game there are IAPs mentioned and they range in price from $.99 to $19.99. I have yet to find them in this app but the Team Happy Face is a clue that something is possible to purchase. Since I have not been able to find them I can only assume that they are turned off. I hope the developers leave them off and my rating is based on the fact that they will stay off.Summary:I found the game to be fun to play and the controls on the Kindle Fire work well. The graphics and sound are good and they actually add to the game experience by giving you warnings when the shark is coming for example. The game is moderately difficult as I have yet to reach 2000 yards swimming.So far I have been able to buy multiple fish and not had to make any IAPs in the games with real money. It hasn't even asked me to make an IAP with real money. Many reviews are commenting on this but I have yet to need to do it and I am winning enough money to buy the fish and powerups I need. Every fish seems to swim slightly different and they also are larger or smaller which makes a difference for swimming between small and tight areas of the screen.This game is a never ending game that you just continue playing a level until you die or sent back. So far I have enjoyed the game. I also like that the game keeps your stats for you, they are stored under Menu.You should make sure that on-line purchasing is turned off just in case. I had mine on to see if it asked me to buy anything and it never did.My only disappointment was 14 five star reviews at the start of the day and some were obviously fake. Developers should count on their game being good enough to get positive votes and not post high scores to try to sway people's opinions.I rate the game as a 4 star game.Size: The app puts 536 KB in your app memory on the Kindle Fire and 20.822 MB in the memory area reserved for books data and other entertainment items like music and movies.Permissions:* Storage - modify/delete internal storage contents* Network communication - full internet access* System tools - prevent Kindle from sleeping* Network communication - view network state"}

{"label": 1, "data": "Excellent one-tap solution to monitoring the Kindle Fire's remaining charge and battery usage.  This app tells you how the battery is actually being used (percentages for screen, wi-fi active, held awake, app usage); and sends notifications (to the notification area at the top left of the home screen) that include the current charge level plus an estimate of the time left (based on your average usage).If you choose \"App Sucker\" from the list menu, you see a list of apps that shows the percentage of battery consumed by each app.  If you select a particular app, you get detailed stats on CPU usage, keep awake, wake locks, bytes sent and received, included packages, included processes, etc.  These stats let you know which apps are power-hungry, and what they're doing.This is exactly what I wanted for my Kindle Fire.  Another battery monitor,BatteryTime Lite, which is apparently designed for cell phones, didn't work for me because it requires entry of the Kindle Fire's battery capacity (a figure that I don't have).  ThisBadass Battery Monitorworks off the Kindle Fire's battery charge level, so it works \"out of the box\" without needing any additional technical information.EDITED 11/16/12:I liked this app so well, that I purchased the version made specifically for the 1st Gen Kindle Fire (theGSam Battery Monitor (Kindle Tablet Edition)).  Today I received my wi-fi Kindle Fire HD 8.9\" tablet, and was delighted to find that the GSam Battery Monitor app for the Fire works with the new tablet, too.  I didn't have to purchase a new version, as I did with quite a few of my existing non-HD Fire apps."}

The games are short and seemed thrown together and didn't make sense.A lot of things were ridiculous filler and a waste of time (eg. objects or people light up/glow & tell you to click on it - like \"talk to John Smith\" then it starts the script) and other games started timing you all of a sudden (huh?).

{"label": 0, "data": "I got this based on the wonderfully rendered graphics in the sample screen shots, and the glowing first review (5 stars, must be a plant).The &quot;sample&quot; images are pretty much all there is to the game -- there are maybe a dozen images total, making up one of the shortest games I've ever downloaded. Having paid more for it than I have for other, significantly superior games is a painful lesson learned: wait for more reviews next time.In addition to being unacceptably short, there are puzzles in the game that give you no indication of having been solved. Solving them triggers progress elsewhere, but there was no visual indicator that you'd hit upon the solution. In one instance there was a sound, but searching the area yielded no object to find. Only on  un/reinstalling and playing the game a second time (literally took 3 minutes beginning to end) did I figure out what had been achieved by solving the puzzles.Additionally, the gameplay is sluggish and buggy. For example, your inventory often pops up unbidden, or, conversely, is open but not visible on the screen, not allowing for any movement. I had exited the game a few times, believing there was something wrong a restart might correct, before figuring this out. There are also no sound/music controls, which is a pet peeve of mine. And, finally, tapping in the general vicinity of the Menu button tosses you out of the game. You reenter fairly close to where you had left off, but loading takes a while, and it's just generally annoying.One last oddity, the description says you are an Englishman from an earlier era (18th or 17th century, don't remember), yet the opening graphic talks about doing research on World War II. Can't imagine why the discrepancy -- a change in story, or an image taken from somewhere else?"}

So there was a lot of bagging.  But my partner (bot/AI) \"changed\" strategy, and doesn't do that anymore.  The other programmed team (bots/AI) have not.  I took out one star for automatic changing of strategies.  I wish you could choose a partner (bot/AI) and it would have a set strategy depending on which one you picked.Spades is a team card game, not a puzzle game.  With the partner (bot/AI) changing strategy without notification, you have to change your own personal strategy?  It'd be better if only the opposing team (bots/AI) were the ones that changed strategy.Also, so far, there is no aggressive nil busting intention.  So, lots of aces and kings on a nil are being played, even with a total bid goal of 10.But, it's still fun enough, I do like puzzle games, and now I know what to expect."}

So, though I thought the game was good, I'm stuck with no way to proceed. In addition, when there is a problem like this, I think amazon needs a &quot;return due to defect&quot;  for these apps and games.

{"label": 0, "data": "I got this as the freebie app of the day for my Kindle Fire and I am glad that I didn't pay for it. I ended up uninstalling it.You can mix sounds (rowing, paddling, rain, camp fire, splash, wind, ocean, thunder, whale song, beach, sand walking, and storm). Whale song is not relaxing and the wind sound belongs in a horror movie.Oh, the music. Um. The music is pretty awful new age stuff and could potentially be used as a torture device.The underlying idea is to mix sounds and music. You can turn the music off (thankfully!) by hitting pause.Mixing the sounds together (excluding whale song and wind) and turning everything up to 100% and hitting pause to do away with the \"music\" does a reasonably OK job of creating a kind of white-ish background noise.There is a timer and and alarm. The timer is buggy because you can't see the minutes properly. If you delete what is in the minutes and type something in, you can figure it out and then check the countdown time remaining once you OK it.So, it could have potentially been an OK sleep sound machine...BUT it wouldn't turn off when I exited the app. And then the music reappeared. In my desperation to turn off the noise, I uninstalled the app. Whew!I really can't think of a good reason to go with this program. If you do want a sleep sound machine, just stick with the excellent Sleepy Time."}

{"label": 0, "data": "This is an endless jumper, where you tilt your device to make the automatically-jumping vampire land on platforms rather than plummeting to earth. Some platforms will break after being landed on once; some will change color and disappear after a couple landings; some move. You can pick up items that will boost your speed or make you move automatically, while other items will make you fall and must be dodged. In other words, it's a lot like Doodle Jump, a game I hadn't heard of before today but quickly downloaded to see how much like it Vam Jump was. In fact, they're virtually the same, and all the differences work against Vam Jump. Doodle Jump has sharper graphics (Vam Jump looks kind of lame on an HD screen), an additional gameplay dynamic (shooting enemies, which Vam Jump doesn't include), and more responsive tilt control (no matter how you adjust the tilt sensitivity in the options menu, the vampire's movements never quite feel natural the way the Doodle Jump creature's movements do). So Vam Jump is both inferior and a knockoff. And, at $2.99, it's three times the price of Doodle Jump to boot. While it's free, you might as well grab this if it sounds interesting, but it's not remotely worth paying for. Adults will get bored quickly. Young enough kids might have more fun, but young enough kids will also have fun playing with a plastic bag, and that doesn't mean plastic bags are worth $2.99. If the developers cut the price to $0.99, this would be a three-star app, but for now, two stars it is."}

Cons: it is not really a free to roam world,it's more like a connection of large levels, you must continuously eat fish or you will starve, and in game gold is received very slowly. There has been no adds so far and the game doesn't pester you with in app purchases. It's very fun and should be in your game collection.

Just aceptable for the hight quality graphics.-LOTS AND LOTS OF BUGS, and the principal reason why I give it 3 stars, some tracks are unplayable because of this, just screwed my perspective of the game. I guess that may run as expected on a coolest device but in my KFHD 8.9' just don't.-The controls and the gameplay just ehh... sometimes it doesn't response and makes you lose the race with crashing or things like that, besides that it doesn't respects the physics rules, but who does?-A money sucker, you will spend more than one buck.I'am a great fan of gameloft and the asphalt series are one of my favorites, so please fix it and we could be all happy. :D thanks and have a nice day."}

The first problem, I think, was 4/1, the next was 3+1, and so on, to things like 39-12, and finally to 247/14 or whatever.  Obviously this app is not meant for children to practise their math skills, or it would include the following:- Choice of operand- Choice of difficulty- Choice of answer total (up to 10, 20, 100, 1000, etc.)- Choice of using regrouping or not using regrouping in addition and subtraction- Choice of format (fractions, decimals, etc.)- Choice of number of questions asked- Choice of scoring method- Record and report time spent playing, scores on various operations, and anything else a parent might want to know if they are monitoring their child's educational app time.As I said, the app froze up my device twice and I was not inclined to pursue it further after this, so maybe it does include some of these things, but I could not access the settings menu, so I have no idea.

If you selected &#34;precise&#34;, it meant that any words you spelled correctly, even if they were less common words, it would assume that you meant to type the word you spelled correctly.A few versions ago, Swiftkey removed that option.  They claimed in a response that it now automatically figures it out.  How clever!  As someone who has used Swiftkey for years, both the new and old versions, I can tell you for certain that this just flat out doesn't work.  Swiftkey is constantly &#34;correcting&#34; words I spell correctly because obviously I am too stupid to be talking about science or literature, I MUST have meant some other word relating to iphones or teenybopper culture.It's still the best-arranged keyboard out there, but the spelling correction is a blunt moron which assumes the user to be the goof."}

I messed around trying to get it to work for hours, then had my dad look at it (who is a computer tech). I downloaded the samsung drivers from the website, and tried many others. At first, it would work for short intervals. I would connect for a couple of minutes, then it would disconnect for no reason. After my dad looked at it for an hour or so, he figured that since the samsung drivers arent certified, windows home version would not allow it to work. I dunno.

{"label": 1, "data": "I give LineUp! two and a half stars, but rounded up to three because Amazon only allows ratings by whole stars. Essentially, the game has potential but needs some kinks and polishing.The game has no formal tutorial level, but it does demonstrate new concepts as they are introduced.Graphics are nice. My Kindle Fire had no problems with displaying them and there was no input lag.The volume is a single toggle. By default all the sounds are enabled. Press the button once and the music is muted while leaving other sound enabled (&quot;FX&quot;). Press it again and all sound is muted. If any of it is too loud, the player will have to adjust their device's sound volume. I muted the music because, while catchy, was distracting. Minus half a star for the sound control and background music that does not stay in the background.The biggest issue was playability. A number of times, the game wanted me to connect color squares that I could not reach with any move. The only thing that slightly reduced the frustration is a player is given three hearts; if the player goofs up, you still have a chance to recover. The hearts reset back to three once the player moves on to the next level. Minus one star.LineUp! does have Facebook integration, hence the network permission. It seems that it's for a score leaderboard but I couldn't verify since I do not have a Facebook account.I played several levels, then exited the app. Unfortunately, the app does not actually shut down when I used the Kindle's back arrow. It doesn't seem to be much of a battery drainer, but when I want an app closed, I want it closed! Minus a star.As a Free App of the Day, it is probably worth acquiring and hoping for more updates. It's also worth it if you like timed puzzles."}

It has the goods, it really does, but heavy IAP at every turn (three routes to the same purchase screen on one menu is kinda overkill) and FB/Twitter link bribes (I really dislike social media bribes) just flatten this otherwise great game.The music alone made me laugh out loud, extremely reminiscent of a certain 60s noir, \"Ya, tapping the frog is my bag, baby!\"  Fun, light hearted theme, minimal network permission, crisp, vibrant graphics, very responsive touch controls, a huge variety of simple tap to far more complex game styles, kid-appropriate action, all the makings of a stellar production.Except the IAP and social media presence really is overbearing for a paid game, especially with IAPs as much and more than the price of the game itself.  If this was always a free game, 5 stars with the kid caveat of disabling purchases.  As a paid game that relies a bit too heavy on extra time clocks for full star completions... sorry, Frogger, going to have to throw you under the bus.*And double ugh.  I was looking closer at the IAPs since much older reviews imply that the whole IAP extra clock aspect is a recent addition.  I found two different IAP packages off to the edge that offer to SELL Full Game unlocks and DISABLE in-game advertising.  What!?  Then what are folks paying the .99 cents for?  Entry Fee to the Carnival of Greed?  Dudes, super uncool.  I accept this sort of pile-on tactic without much twitching in Gameloft's freemium games, but this one is starting to feel too froggy for comfort.*"}

{"label": 1, "data": "It does what it was designed for. It's not hard to master. Just read the description.I had no troubles with this app. Next song started at the beginning of that song. Do notice that it remembers your selection. So next time you go to the same song it will play only that part.You can easily adjust your selection by dragging the start arrow to the beginning. Than, of course, the song will start at the beginning.  And if you drag the stop arrow to the end, you can listen to the complete song (obviously).You can place several bookmarks in a song, but can only make one selection. So if you want to learn another part you have to make adjustments by dragging your arrows to the beginning and the end of the part you want to learn.Marks can be deleted, selection not (that i know of).As the developer says it's great to learn a language. You can find other purposes like learning lyrics from a song. Just learn one sentence and once memorised you add the next sentence by only dragging the stop arrow. Or you can use it for learning a riff. Although, in that case you lack the ability to slow down the music.There is also a small timegap each time it repeats. So it's not a fluent loop. This means you can't use it as a looper (for musicians).Layout is simple. You get big buttons. It's like it's designed for old people. No bells and whistles. No settings for changing colours or font(size). No visual effects. Just the basics.My final conclusion: it does the job. Simple but effective. Is it worth 3$? I would say no. Maybe if they add more features, like speed change, multiple selections, and even such stupid things like changing colours of the layout. For the moment I wouldn't agree to pay more than 0,99$.

Kids like to spend as soon as an item becomes available  and have to beware not to spend the crowns in spite of much prompting from the game. This game is almost impossible to play without them.

Unlike great games like Lost City, Alice Trapped in Wonderland, The Adventures of Mosaika, and The Secret of Grisly Manor, whose scenes are reached by journeying through varied \"landscapes\", this game's \"pathways\" are identical corridors.  You almost have to use the \"map\" button to see where you are in relation to the various rooms.  Furthermore, I find many of the puzzles to be nonsensical.  Even with the help clues, it's a struggle to solve some of them.  I haven't finished the game yet but I ran into a roadblock with the \"star chart/navigation console\" puzzle in scene 11.  I had to resort to searching for a walk-through on the internet to get the proper \"navigation setting\" and even then, the solution did not make any sense to me.

As a media designer, and freelancer, I like to look at these things to see what&#8217;s next in children&#8217;s education software and where I can apply my degree, and this is another great one I&#8217;ve found.With Preschool Easter Kids Games, you will find there is a lot to learn, but more importantly to have fun with. This game never feels like a game, and that&#8217;s why I love it. The sound design is great, the colors are awesome, and you get to pick between a few games. From tracing, matching, building, and coloring, children will enjoy doing just about everything in this game.I played through it a few times and never felt bored or frustrated. I can see children playing and enjoying this one, especially the coloring and tracing. The other games are fun too, but coloring and tracing were definitely stand outs.I recommend this one, it&#8217;s fun, and it doesn&#8217;t take itself too seriously. You won&#8217;t feel like it&#8217;s an education game, that&#8217;s for sure."}

{"label": 0, "data": "but it's certainly lacking and keeps you mildly entertained. I gave it 3 stars because of how well designed the game was and nice graphics. What makes it boring though is how you don't get to interact to much with the guys (like seriously 4 lines where you can choose your interaction) and the rest of the game is you &#34;working&#34; by tapping that you work but not doing anything at all. What made me like their flower game so much in Fairbrooke is that there was a game you played every time you worked so it did not feel boring.I was bored here, it was repetitious, and the whole point of  the game of deciding outcomes for which guy to date never really had a chance to occur. It would just show a bubble saying that you talked to so and so when no such conversation actually took place.More interaction please!! And allow the players to do something while they &#34;work&#34;  like in the other game so this does not play so monotonously doing practically nothing since you never interact with other guys for conversations and the whole game passes like freebo.The game is over and it's like, &#34;ahh....&#34; it never really improved, wtf?!So yeah, bored gamer.Love the graphics though and design.

{"label": 1, "data": "I've owned multiple iPods (Touch, shuffle, and now my Nano) and a first generation Zune.  I've owned other mp3 players.  With all but one (a SanDisk product I owned a long time ago) I've always complained about how they treat audiobooks, usually as an afterthought.  In fact, I'm sure I've mentioned it in every mp3 player I've reviewed.Even with the Android I was not happy with the MP3 player as, it too, had the same problem.  But Android held the potential that somebody would design a better player with Audiobooks in mind, specifically the ability to bookmark.  What I didn't expect to find, or even think of, was a player with nothing BUT audiobooks in mind.  And then I found Ambling!This is FANTASTIC!!!  It has nearly everything I'm looking for (I'll make a wish list at the end) and makes for a great audiobook listening experience.  I also love how customizable it is, even giving you the option to determine how far back to \"rewind\" a book.  Apple sticks it at 30 seconds, which I think is too much and they do not allow you to change that option.  The 15 seconds they suggest is pretty good... I'm more for about ten seconds myself with a five-second skip forward.Another option that I love is that when you haven't listened to a book for a little bit it will jump back a few seconds (an option you can turn off if you don't like that).  How excellent!  It is nice to catch the last few sentences to re-establish yourself into a scene or conversation.  Again with Apple I either have to accept the jarring or listen to a full 30 seconds when I jump back into a book.They even have the ability to find and download audiobooks (some for free) off the Internet.One feature that I love is that it doesn't only show the progress of a chapter, or audio file (depending on how it is split up) but it shows the progress of the entire book as well!  It probably isn't that big a deal because with some quick math I can usually figure it out on other players, but it is nice to look down and see the overall progress and how much time altogether I have for an entire book.Another reason this has become my go-to player is that when I'm listening to my iPod and a phone call comes in on my cell phone (my Android phone) I have to pause the audiobook on the iPod and then answer the phone.  With Ambling it pauses automatically and then automatically resumes as soon as the phone call is over.The bookmarking features are GREAT!!  Yes, I do listen to multiple books at once as I usually have two books on non-fiction and one -- sometimes two -- books on fiction.  So the bookmarking is a must-have feature that I think should be built into every mp3 player.  Not only can you manually set a bookmark, but one is set every time you pause a book as well.  That way if you change books without bookmarking you can easily find and go back to where you left off on a particular book with a few taps of your finger.  You can even name your bookmarks, in case there is a passage you wish to listen to again and again (I do this with my scriptures).I like how this creates an icon in your notification bar.  This means that, no matter what screen I'm on, if Ambling is running I can bring down the player with a swipe and a poke, and work with the application (pause, run, go to another book, etc).  This is really convenient and a feature I really like.As I've said in some of my other reviews, a product is only as good as its support.  This app has excellent support!  Case-in-point: I had a question with regards to the player and sent them an Email on a Sunday, not expecting a reply until at least the next day.  I was wrong, the reply came within an hour... ON A SUNDAY (I stress).  This actually turned into a bit of a conversation (due to the nature of my question), but within a couple of hours everything was taken care of.  Did I mention this occurred on a Sunday?  I am very, very, VERY impressed by this and it is comforting to know that if I do have any problems it will most likely get resolved quickly.Here is my wishlist of features I would love to see.  Not a lot, but just thought I'd throw it out there:1) Okay, there is one thing that Apple DOES do better than this player.  They have the option to play audiobooks at double speed.  I don't truly get a 2:1 speed, but it speeds things up about 25-40%, significantly reducing the time required to \"read\" a book without distorting the sound of the reader (he or she doesn't sound like a chipmunk).  I'd love it if Ambling \"borrowed\" this capability.2) I've had Ambling for a long time, and for some reason I thought this had a widget once upon a time.  Am I thinking of something else?  If they did, I would love it if they brought it back.  If not, I'd love it if they added one.  Something with the basic features (play, pause, skip forward, skip back, open program) since 95% of what I do with an audiobook does NOT require the full-screen program.3) I'm not sure if Amazon would allow it, but if it could tie into the Amazon Cloud Storage that would be AWESOME!The bottom line is that if you are into audio-books then this is a MUST HAVE program for you."}

If you're using a low-end phone with little internal storage, you will likely find this app to be one of the first to be uninstalled when you run low on space.Developers, please correct the following.1) Allow restaurant data to be stored to the SD card.2) Reduce the size of said data. Nutrition info should be measured in KB, not MB.3) Fix the scrolling. The right frame lags behind when scrolling up and down.4) Give the user the option to use \"Landscape\" view by default; the menu is unreadable in portrait mode.5) Generally do more bug testing and improve the app's performance. The app is slow and somewhat unresponsive.6) Add more restaurants. Why is Chili's featured, but not Olive Garden? They are both in the same general price range and are both considered casual restaurants.Overall I do NOT recommend purchasing this app. I am glad it was free for today; otherwise I would be asking for a refund. primarily due to the space issue (see 1 and 2 above) I will be uninstalling it shortly."}

You can push the button for it to drop your game symbols on the screen or you can set it on automatically to drop while you set back on watch it play by its self. What I like about this game is that once you win on a group of symbols you get free chances to win move from you bet without having to keep paying coins to play until you loose and have to start a new play and pay  each play until you win another, and another. I won 4  Times. On just one play.  Their game has lots of surprises, and ids loads of fun. What have.

There was one puzzle, \"Wooden Tulips\", that had me going for a good 30mins on \"hard\".  It's a picture of groups of tulips -- some are orange, some are pink, some are aqua, and other colors.Another one, \"Labyrinth\", is a real challenge.  All of the pieces, I swear, could fit into more than one spot!  Imagine you are inside a round tower looking down.  That's the view of the board!The first 10 puzzles are pretty easy -- almost like warmups.  The real challenges start with \"Flower Garden\".  It has lots of reds, purples, greens, pinks, and whites.  Plus, there's a close-up shot of a garden then ANOTHER garden off in the distance.\"Dahlia Flowers\" is another obstacle.  The picture is looking down into a single flower with purple and white petals.  The pieces look all the same.  Plus, the center of the board is a yellow piece but there are also three other places where a yellow piece can be played!  These people are insane!\"Chilli Peppers and Mushroom\" is just a big pile of red pieces in various sizes and shapes.\"Meditation Hall\" is a pretty puzzle of an all-white building that sits on a lake.The one I really feared was \"Sheet Music\".  Imagine taking a piece of sheet music, slicing it into 40-50 pieces then spinning everything around!  It's insanely hard on the easier difficulty levels but medium/hard will tax your patience!I still can't believe this pack was only a dollar.  Plus, it can import custom images too.

{"label": 1, "data": "This game is really quite fun. I have to give kudos to Rovio for the smart design. It's designed to keep you playing the game longer than you normally would which is a cool thing to be able to do. You keep thinking: \"I don't want to leave until these critters are fed\" or \"It's only a few more minutes until the rock is done so I can build the next house.\" Before you know it thirty minutes has passed. It's really easy to level up as well. You simply follow the chores. I'd advise you to stock up on food early on with the berries. They're plentiful. Save using the gems as well. It takes 75 to build the Bear Owl trap which makes coins for you. Good job on the game. Actually makes me want to watch the movie. Perfect time management. Great job.EDIT: I changed my review after advancing further into the game. Why? I'm pretty convinced this game is a trick to get kids to spend money on money and gems. It's much too hard to get money in the game. Worst of all the time it takes to build homes is insanely long. The only way to speed it up is to get gems which are very hard to come buy. Not only that, but as you advance the homes become absurdly priced. Hence, I'm all but convinced this is a money trap for kids. So parents, make sure your in-app purchases are disabled. The game is still interesting, but I grow tired of it because of the difficulty accumulating money, and how long it takes to build things."}

{"label": 0, "data": "This is like one of those simple arcade games you came across in the 80s.  Imagine a treadmill's track (which is the water) and you are a shark (you can choose from a few different sized, looking ones).  You move the shark from left to right by tilting your Kindle Fire device trying to bump (you don't eat) swimmers as the treadmill ocean brings them towards you (there's a couple of different swimmers, some are on rafts but there's not many variations for the graphics). You get points for the more swimmers you bump. The treadmill also brings towards you a gold ship with a pointy bit at the front from time to time.  If you clip it or it runs into you, the game is over. That's basically the game, you can make the treadmill go faster with your finger but that's it.  It's really not very challenging.  With the old arcade buttons it may have been more challenging if it was around back then on a machine but by tilting the device to move it's pretty much just one for toddlers who need to learn eye hand co-ordination maybe, any older and the player is likely to be bored midway though the first play, but parents probably aren't going to buy it for little kids with the word sexy in the title.You don't need to be connected to Wi-Fi to play this once it's downloaded, it has that going for it.

But it's only because there are sooooo many terrible ones out there; copycats, blatantly stupid, unimaginative, permissions up the wazoo, you name it.  Bottom line most apps out there just plain ol' suck.  And I'm pleased to say, Draw A Stickman is NOT one of those apps!Now THIS is a truly original app; one that all others should sit up and take notice of.  The game play is simple, straightforward, very well done, and most of all -- FUN!  The controls are genius in their simplicity; anyone from 3 - 103 could play this and it would hold their interest.  And best of all -- it's completely unique to each player, because WE get to draw the main character, and his friend, and then watch our creations be part of the game!Stickman's friend is actually gobbled into the game and you have to rescue him.  How cool is that?  Touch the screen, and your stickman walks there.  Touch a fuse with the fire pencil, and it lights, then blows up the dynamite to clear your path. Cool! Irreverent! Simple! Addictive! ...Oh, and did I mention Fun & Original?  The soundtrack doesn't annoy me over time, like so many other terrible ones do in other apps.It plays well both on my phone (LG Marquee) and my tablet (Toshiba Thrive.) No glitches, hiccups or crashes.  Yes, I've seen other apps that have tried a similar concept of game play based on user drawn input, but they never rose to this level. Not even close.  Most apps out there should be scrapped at the idea stage; they simply aren't worth the time and effort that goes into making them, let alone merit a consumer's time or money. In general, there's a big ho-hum factor in the caliber of Amazon's free App Of The Day offerings.  Sure, there might be a good one, here and there, but generally, they've been complete duds.When all this started, there was actually some great stuff being offered.  But then, it seemed like all the good apps dried up and its mostly been crap.  But that doesn't fall on Amazon alone - most of the apps out there are crap, and that includes Google Play.  Draw A Stickman Epic reminds me of what a good app should look like -- simple to play, well programmed, universal and worthwhile from inception to customer. Oh, and the permissions are almost non-existent, which is exactly how it should be.  Whenever a crap game wants too many permissions, I immediately suspect malware, or perhaps just delusions of grandeur.Stickman Epic is a great game, and good way to cap off a year of mediocrity with these daily freebies.  Good job.  Go for it!  You'll have fun with it! ...We now return to our regular scheduled programming...."}

{"label": 0, "data": "If you XFinity subscribers reading this don't already know, you could already get Showtime content on your Kindle Fire via theXFINITY TV Playerapp.  That app also gives you access to almost all the premium channel content that you subscribe to.  So, what's the difference between the two apps?  For starters, I'm sorry to say that neither will let you export video to your TV.  UnlikeHBO GOand Max Go, both XFinity and Showtime decided to be a sticks in the mud and block this option.  Personally, I found the navigation in the XFinity app to be easier and more intuitive than Showtime Anytime.  Generally speaking, the amount of content is almost the same.  Something along the lines of 137 vs 139 movies, and 17 vs 15 shows.  That's in favor of the Showtime app, by the way.  A brief look says that the difference is in what each offers for the Showtime network's \"After Hours\" section.  Playback quality is equal between the two apps, and both apps have the same amount of stability.  Really, unless the minimal extra \"After hours\" content that you can't live without, I don't really see any reason to pick Showtime Anytime over XFinity TV Player.  If they start allowing export to TV, then that would be something at least.*Note: Apps can get updates and change over time, for better or worse.

{"label": 1, "data": "I'm 35 &amp; it took me an hour &amp; 10 min to finish all 3 levels. However, most of the last 20 - 30 min of that was trying to click on a REALLY small difference in the last level. The big crab level also had a hard to select difference. Super frustrating being able to see where but not able to select it. I spent a lot of time trying to line up my finger, but when it finally did select it looked like it it might have been off a bit but yet a place I'd tried repeatedly. If they get that fixed I'd say its a good game, a bit short maybe. Total of 13 pictures that have 3 difficulty levels for each. The first 10 pictures are open but the last 3 need to be unlocked at 1st, 2nd &amp; 3rd levels. On the 1st level, there are 5 differences to find at your own pace. The 2nd has 6 differences &amp; the 3rd has 7, both require you to finish in 35 seconds (I think its seconds, it has 35 tick marks anyway.) Once you find everything, every level can be played again as the differences do switch around each time. The game has NO permissions, ads, or in app purchases, NOTHING...so that's a big plus especially for kids. App takes up 14.12MB, but it does have nice bright graphics. At its current difficulty of selection, it seems like its a bit too much for the age group its targeting. I'm assuming 3 to maybe 7 since the startup screen said &quot;My First Games.&quot; If they find the difference, small as it may be, they need to be able to select it in 2 or 3 tries at most not 37 (I ran out of time past that.) Aside from those 2 pictures at all 3 levels, that I had serious difficulty selecting, I found it mildly entertaining enough to stick with it till the end. I probably won't play it again but I have a 4 yr old niece &amp; 7 yr old nephew who might like it."}

{"label": 0, "data": "I had the good fortune to play a similar game called \"7 Little Words\" first: [...]In comparison, this game is very poor. The clues don't always match the answers as well as they ought (e.g. the clue for \"heel\" was \"foot\" rather than \"part of the foot\", the clue for \"rabbit\" was \"magic hat\", etc.). Also there's no way inside the game to turn sound off. If you don't want to listen to the sound of the camera shutter every time you make a guess, you have to turn your device's sound down. It was a bit embarrassing when I was playing this in the bathroom with the door closed and my wife walked past and thought I was, er, taking pictures.The interface is uglier than the one in '7 Little Words\" as well. The only real advantage is this version of the game has more free puzzles than does the other; hence two stars instead of one - but I don't know how much longer I'll keep the bloody thing if there are so many small details I find a little grating."}

You have to go to the main menu to access it--takes a while to load, and the scroll action is, well, I guess you'd say 'loose'; it went flying at the least swipe.  I found a walkthrough on-line, too.  I used it pretty much as a visual back-up to the game's text hints.  They give you a camera to take photos along the way.  Take photos of everything you see--some have to be taken to advance the game.I enjoyed the game, although at times it was frustrating.  I would recommend, but maybe not for 1st-time escapers.

Keeps them quiet and entertained easily for 30 - 60 minutes at a time (they are ages 6 and 10). Very easy for kids to use on their own and works really GREAT on my KINDLE FIRE! For our family, it was worth every penny. I don't understand about reviews that mentioned technical problems because it's worked every time on our Kindle. Also, VERY EASY TO SHARE the photos that capture your kids true personalities LOL.I also wanted to add that this is one app where I don't need to worry about Wi-Fi access. So many Kindle apps require internet connections and I'm many waiting rooms,etc. You don't have that luxury. Once you upload this app onto your device (from the cloud) you DO NOT need internet Wi-Fi access to use it... you would need it to share the photos, but you can always share them when you get back home."}
{"label": 0, "data": "For those old enough to remember the Sierra games of the 80's and early 90's that established this particular genre, then we remember plot-driven, story engaging puzzles that really satisfied for the time (yes, even LEISURE SUIT LARRY).  Modern developers really should harken back to classic examples of what makes a visual point-click puzzler stand up and deliver an all-around experience.  Just throwing in random riddles, vague hint systems, unconnected props, and dressing it all up with HD graphics and generic music does not make a winner.  CRYPTIC KINGDOMS, by the same publisher, at least had a feeling of being appropriate to the environment, yet CRYPTIC CAVERNS is just a jumble of strewn together elements that technically entitles a category.External Storage Permission - doesn't seem to use it directly,  but can be moved manually and played from a USB cardQuick load up and an auto-save feature when back-key exits, CRYPTIC CAVERNS ran at 53mbs RAM in an idle state. Repetitious \"mystery\" music and \"bleep-blwoop\" sound effects can be turned off and on, tutorial that is in sum \"touch things and then touch more things\", and an in-game hint system that does little more than to direct the player to certain scenes in order to progressively solve puzzles.  The plot is as bare bones as a 10th grade essay on Tudor history, nothing more than a loose tie-in with a vague steampunk Lovecraft vibe, which in itself can be a cool mixture but misses the immersing details.  And I only include the term steampunk because of an oddly locked axe in some sort of pressure mechanism that had no environmental connection to anything, not even the clue that solves it.  How enthralling.Nothing about CRYPTIC CAVERNS stylistic choices shouts \"Awesome!\", yet no inherent technical aspects makes it terrible.  Middle-of-the-road point-click adventuring that could have used internal polish.  The examples are there... just check out the ancient but highly popular KING'S QUEST series by Sierra.

I know it has been a long time since I was taught to print but some of the writing methods for the letters of the alphabet are just strange. I wasn't taught to write that way and it just seems wrong. I am not sure that I want my child to learn to write in such a manner.2. The volume of the voices goes up and down a lot on my Kindle Fire from a little above a whisper to a loud voice.3. Why does a children's game need network communications?4. Why does a children's game need Kindle Calls control to read the Kindle state and identity and where is it sending it?5. Why does a children's game need to view network status?6. Why does a children's game need to have a link to see and buy other games? Even if there is a simple child's lock I just don't get it.7. This game is 19.35 MB in size and based on this it should be freestanding and it does not need to access the Internet via the network for any reason.This could have been a great little app for children but there are just too many iffy things in this app that do not need to be there. Take out all the permissions, the store and fix the writing guidance to be done properly and this could have been a 5 star. As it is I struggle to give it a 3 star rating. I am also not sure I would give a child a $200 Kindle Fire or a smart phone to learn how to write. I would probably prefer to teach them with a crayon and a piece of paper and some good parental guidance. That would be more fun and educational!"}

THIS is how.Rayman Fiesta Run is built from the same touch-based platform gameplay that was molded from the winning formula that madeRayman Originssuch a blast to play! This time, there are multiple colorful food-themed worlds lined up on a map for you to pick from, but the core play is, well, the same as before - Just as fun!There isn't really that much I have to say about the app, but I would like to mention the Invaded (a laRayman Legends) levels that you unlock by collecting all 4 Teensies (As you collect lums, you can earn up to 4 Teensies in each level) in the respective levels. They are more-or-less intense versions of the levels you've mastered to unlock them, but of course, provide a higher challenge.You know, it's quite a debate as to what franchise does the App Store best, whether it be something likeAngry Birds,Cut the Rope,Candy Crush, etc. I believe the real winner here is Rayman!"}

But for me the advantage to this app is that it *doesn't* sync with anything else. I'm a minister, using this app as a log, and keeping it local reassures me that it will be confidential.It works well as a log because it's tied to a calendar.  I like the fact that you can tag notes with different colors - so I can easily sort out my notes.  Only othe first  line from each note shows in the list below the calendar, but with a little planning you can use the one line to show whatever key information will work best for you.The notes are easily edited. The interface seems to be intuitive. So far I'm happy.  The one thing I would really like to see them change is their insistance that the tablet (on the kindle fire, at least) be in portrait mode with the power button on the bottom (where I always bump it! grrrr!)I do hope that if the developers *do* add in the ability to sync to google, they will make it optional."}

{"label": 0, "data": "This is a knockoff of the app Flappy Bird, which was removed from the market earlier this year.  The icon which you contol is a cat in this version, not a bird. This one costs a buck when it's not the free app of the day, and the original was always free.  It is funny that A-zon is offering us a knock off, but they're a strange bunch.For some reason, this A-zon version requires 22 times more memory than the original.  This is probably because cats weigh more than birds, but I still wonder what makes this version so huge and memory hungry to do the same job.I give it a below average review for being a copycat program, and requiring so much power from my phone.  If the original programmer could make the app much smaller, why can't this developer.  I suggest he change the icon from a cat to a mouse, and make this app one half the size of the original app.If this is your kind of app, you'll like one Appazon offered a while back as the Free App of the Day, called \"The Impossible Game\" - this is actually a better value for a buck if you miss this game for free today.  It will also drive you crazyThe Impossible Game Level Packand you can test drive it on a home computer to see if you actually like it.For the best background on the original app, and this copy, you should look at that online encyclopedia which sums it up the best...Flappy Bird is a 2013 mobile game, developed by Vietnam-based developer Nguy&#7877;n H&agrave; ng[3][4] (Dong Nguyen) and published by .GEARS Studios, a small, independent game developer also based in Vietnam.[5] The game has a side-scrolling format and the player controls a bird, attempting to fly between rows of green pipes without coming into contact with them. The developer created the game over several days, using a bird protagonist which he had designed for a cancelled game in 2012.The game was released on May 24, 2013 but received a sudden rise in popularity in early 2014. It was criticized for its level of difficulty and alleged plagiarism in graphics and game mechanics, while other reviewers found it addictive. At the end of January 2014, it was the most downloaded free game in the iOS A-Store. During this period, its developer claimed that Flappy Bird was earning $50,000 a day from in-app advertisements.Flappy Bird was removed from both A's A-Store and GPlay by its creator on February 10, 2014, due to guilt over what he considered to be its addictive nature. The game's popularity and sudden removal caused phones with it pre-installed to be put up for sale for high prices over the Internet.[6][7][8] Games similar to Flappy Bird became popular on the iTunes App Store in the wake of its removal, and both A and G have removed games from their app stores for being too similar to the original. A-zon likes their copies.  The game has also been distributed through unofficial channels on multiple platforms."}

I enjoy completing my families and just watching them for a while. Upgrading isn't terribly taxing until they start getting over 50k, so expanding is pretty easy for a good long while.It would be really great to get a peanut or two when levelling up, and for some quests more often, cuz it's a recession you know. For those of us on fixed incomes, buying peanuts isn't a really feasible idea. And charging hundreds of peanuts for one animal just ain't gonna cut it. Especially when you need TWO to finish the family.I also have a beef with searching for the higher animals. Even filling the friend slots using earned peanuts, I found absolutely NO improvement in finding or capturing the animal. I invariably spend more than half my fuel to find it, and once the animal runs, it's over unless you want to waste peanuts on more fuel, with little chance of both finding and capturing it. I once spent approximately 6x the animal's worth just to snag the first one. Really ticked me off.BIGGEST COMPLAINT!!!!!Gameloft REALLY needs to help their players connect. I have tons of FB friends but they don't do tablet games, so I have zero friends for this &quot;social networking game&quot;. Other games I play give you the ability to visit random zoos and leave your ID with a request to friend each other. A great help!!! A other one I play will give you a list of recommended players to send friend requests to. LIFESAVER!!!Gameloft appears to expect you to actually get your personal, local friends to be your entire possible friend pool. I might be insane, but I was under the impression that games like this were supposed to help you reach out to players all over the world. How am I supposed to do that with no help from Gameloft to find people who actually play the same game(s) I do?!Seriously Gameloft, ADDRESS THIS ISSUE PLEASE!I play a number of Gameloft games and it would help me TREMENDOUSLY to actually get friend zoos to visit.But I still love this game. &gt;.&gt;"}

In future releases a version without, or opt out, of facebook would be appreciated.Having to purchase, or post to facebook, for investment points is truly disappointing.  Why not just charge a nominal fee for the game or let users convert virtual city cash to investment points?  For now I will just play the waiting game and see how long getting it takes to accumulate  points without using the above methods.If the integration of FB or paying for points doesn't bother you then I am sure you will enjoy the game more than I have."}

This new app is Brilliant!  My Daughter is hooked!  Need I say more??  What parent doesn&#8217;t want their child to excel in school and all areas of learning?  Thanks to your incredible Math apps&#8230;she is even more of a wiz in math.  And now I finally have a way to help her with reading and spelling!This free version is certainly worth downloading for any parent that wants the best for their child.  The high quality learning tools that are at your fingertips are indispensable.  I always try out free versions when I can because my daughter is very picky with her games and apps.  She is Autistic and it not only has to capture her attention but, has to KEEP it as well.  I never have a problem with that as long as there are 22learn apps out there!Hailey is in the fourth grade and although this app is for preschool and on up, it has still helped her with her pronunciation tremendously!  The Free version has the Preschool level and 2 out of 6 games unlocked.  It only took a couple hours until she decided she wanted the full version.

{"label": 1, "data": "I've seen &#34;Sprinkle&#34; compared to &#34;Angry Birds,&#34; but it reminded me more of &#34;Where's My Water,&#34; since it requires directing a quantity of water to certain locations, although beyond that, there's not much in common. With Sprinkle, you're using an adjustable, aim-able water cannon to put out fires before they burn down the villagers' houses.Sprinkle is a fast-paced game, and you have to be quick. On each level, the action begins immediately. For me, it's a two-handed game, with my right thumb pushing the water button, and my left thumb controlling the height and direction of the water cannon. For some levels, you can hose down the fires directly, but on most levels, you'll have to use different strategies; for example, spraying a rock to roll it into position to act as a dam.The game is very challenging, and it's going to take me many hours to beat every level. At least if you're stuck on a level, you can move on to the next level and come back later. Your score depends on how much water you have to use to put out all the fires. That makes the replay value of Sprinkle very high, since you always have the challenge of improving your score.My only (slightly) negative comment is about the way you aim the water cannon. You'll have to experiment a bit to coordinate moving the water cannon up and down and to aim it. It's tricky until you get the hang of it.I'm playing Sprinkle on a Kindle Fire. The cartoon-like graphics are excellent, and the game plays smoothly with no hesitations. It's a good game for anyone who wants a real challenge."}

{"label": 1, "data": "I used to play freecell with cards occasionally, but it's been a while. After getting this app, I realized how difficult freecell can be - I guess I must have been cheating when using cards!The look and feel of this app are very nice. I like the animation of dealing and playing cards and even the menu. The UI does not follow current design standards, but to me that's not a negative at all. If there's one downside, the cards are rather small, even when rotated to landscape, and in portrait mode the vertical &#34;stacking&#34; is much more compact than it needs to be, so if you have &#34;sausage fingers&#34; this app may be frustrating to you.I like the 'touch a card to make the obvious move' feature and undo is a lifesaver. I also appreciate the hint button that shows all possible moves, and I appreciate that it's smart -- if the only available move moves a card back and forth endlessly between two positions, it realizes this and doesn't keep suggesting that move.The fact that this is ONLY freecell, and you'd have to buy Branium's other solitaire games separately if you want them, is not a big deal to me, but it might be to anyone wanting more variety in their Solitaire playing. I probably wouldn't pay for all of them individually myself, but I'd say it's worth the money if you just want freecell."}

{"label": 0, "data": "For starters the video segments are too small to comfortably watch while doing the exercises. Secondly the accent of the narrator is so thick it is almost not understandable. I admit, I am a newcomer to yoga but I found even the &quot;beginner&quot; level poses and exercises to be somewhat advanced and difficult to do without some prior exposure to the art of yoga. The Yoga Guru Pro app that I downloaded also had the terrible habit of resetting the video to the beginning &quot;still starting picture shot&quot; well before the narrator was finished describing the benefits of each pose session. The narrating was limited to the supposed medical and physical benefits of each pose and NOT instructional as to how the pose should be done.

{"label": 0, "data": "Game Play:This is a match 3 or more game where you are matching animals and you're assigned a mission to catch a certain number of assigned animal types to move up a level. There is a timer and if you catch more animals the time restores. You can reach a point where there are no more moves and the screen will shuffle. There are some help buttons like the binoculars that can show you animals that you can catch. While the animals are disappearing from being matched you can be matching another set so move fast. There is a special flashing panel but use it only when you need it, it deletes some of the animals and may give you some more moves.You can play the normal game or the Tokoton where you catch 100 animals and move to the next stage. Your target of animals to catch appears when you start the level and the total of each animal you have trapped appears on the top of the screen.After you finally get beat your boss yells at you and you get the chance to tell your friends on Facebook and Twitter about the game.Main screen:* Start* Story* How to play* Ranking - keeps the games high scores* Invite - allows you to spam your friends* Sound - off/onWhat I Like:The graphics and the expressions of the animals are cute. The music can get onto your nerves after a while and it is repetitive circus music. The game starts you off easy but it gets harder pretty fast. It increases the animals you have to capture as well as adds in new animals.What I don't like:The clock seems to go pretty fast in the higher levels and you really have to keep moving. This is not your relaxing match three games as the clock moves faster and faster to keep you working at a fast pace.The Invite button and Facebook and Twitter links to the social networks to me are getting old. Why spam your friends with a game? Turn off your WIFI, turn on your airplane mode or parental controls so your children will not use the buttons.Summary:The game is fun to a point but after a few rounds you get bored as it is repetitive and the clock speeds up. It is another match three game with a slight twist. I am also tired of retro graphics games as I have a high resolution device and I want to be amazed in the game play graphics. Retro to me means you don't have a good animator or an artist so you make your graphics poorly. I still have an Atari 400 and 800 in the closet and they work fine but I don't get them out because I miss their graphics.I rate this game a 3 star rating and for children it may be a 4 star but it gets hard pretty quickly so they may become frustrated.Size: The size uncompressed on my Kindle Fire is 4.37 MB.Permissions:* Network communication - full internet access* Network communication - view network state"}

{"label": 0, "data": "Update: I have written step by step instructions on how to turn off IAP's on your Kindle Fire at the bottom of this review.  I hope this information is helpful to you should you choose to turn off this feature.The game graphics are OK but game play may be difficult depending on the sensitivity of your motion sensors within your device. The objects to hit or avoid are in one of three lanes and they are sometimes stacked close together in the same lane and it forces you to hit a red object in order to collect the blue object you may need. The objects can also come after a slight hill and this does not provide you much time to respond as you are moving very fast. The game is difficult as that in after 10 tries I haven't completed the first level. I hope you can fly better than me.There are objects that have to be hit to collect to help you race:* Auto repair automatically repairs the craft's shields over time* Multiplier multiplies the points gathered on the track* Advanced ion reactor lets you squeeze out more energy from gathered ion orbs* Head start skips the easy part and lets you jump right into the high velocities* Red objects that you should avoid or crush using the strike mode* Blue crush objects for points* Blue cross - crush 3 to repair the craft's shields* Ion orbs replenish your craft's energy that is used in strike and focus modes.You also receive points and Kions for collecting ion orbsKions are your currency to buy upgrades for your craft. You can earn them in game play or buy them with real money. You can buy:* 15,000 for $.99* 50,000 for $1.99* 200,000 for $3.99* 500,000 for $4.99 and credits apply only to the single device that you purchased them on.This app is rated for ages 9 and up but downloads Dynamic Content which means:This application contains content that is downloading real-time, based on inputs from the user or developer. The maturity rating associated with this application pertains only to the static elements of the application and does not cover any dynamic information (e.g. websites, friend postings, tweets). Dynamic content is defined as any content that may change within the application. Content can include animations, video or audio.This warning shown above is from Amazon.The app size is 20.1 MB per their specs but can vary depending on downloads.Permissions asked for are:Storage -Modify/delete internal storageFind your network location - coarseNetwork communications - full internet accessNetwork communication - view network stateI find the game's action frustrating to play and the controls are very slow to respond. I don't endorse IAP's and as a result I give this game one star.Do to the continued insistence of App Developers to include the IAP's option in their apps I thought I would provide step by step directions on how to turn off the ability to buy IAP's on your Kindle Fire.  I hope this helps you.How to turn off In App Purchases on your Kindle Fire:* Tap on the Home key and go to the Home page of your Kindle Fire* Touch the Apps tab on top of the screen* Touch the Store tab on top of the screen on the RH side* Touch the menu button located in the center of the screen on the very bottom of the page.  It looks like a page of written paper.* Touch the Settings icon* Touch In-App Purchasing* Unclick the \"Allow In-App item Purchases\" box* A window will pop up and allow you to enter your Amazon Account Password.  Enter your password and touch continue.* You have now turned off your In-App Purchases option and this will help to keep your children or yourself from accidently placing orders.Turning off the feature in this manner shuts off IAP's for all apps you may download. If you wish to turn this feature back on then just repeat this process and check the box to turn on In-App purchases and re-enter your Amazon password.  This lock only applies to turning off IAP's and does not affect your one touch buying which you may also wish to disable. This is your personal preference."}

{"label": 0, "data": "I am taking the time to write this review, because I feel it is necessary. I already have bubble Witch Saga, candy crush saga, and even the Pets Saga. I got all of these apps from the Google Play Store, and they worked correctly. I have an Asus Transformer Prime quad core tablet, and I have a Toshiba 10 inch tablet, also with a quad core processor. both of my super tablets are capable of running any app that is currently developed.the problem that I have yes, why does my quad core tablet report that bubble Witch Saga from the Amazon store is not compatible. It is ridiculous my tegra processors would literally run circles around any kindle tablet. I install the Amazon app store on both of my quad core tablet, because I wanted the function ability of the Amazon app store. Well I'm seriously going to delete it now, I have noticed that the apps are completely different versions on Amazon and they are on Google. I believe the Amazon store is rigged. If an app is compatible on the Google Play Store, for once device, it should be available on the other app store. I feel that Amazon is trying to corner the market, by deceptive dirty practices. And I do not feel that the free app of the day is worth keeping the Amazon app store if they are going to have second rate chopped versions of apps that you could get from the Google Play Store.I also feel that Amazon will probably not even let me publish this unless I say something about the game. So here goes it runs very well on both of my quad core tablet unfortunately I had to download it from another app store so they will not be receiving any of the in app purchases that I purchased frequently. I bet you feel stupid now. You know how many people on a galaxy s4, you know how many people on tablets with Tegra processors. I guess you won't be receiving any of that money and now you know why the Google Play Store is the number one. The Amazon app store is just second rate..... one last funny thing to mention. My quad core tablet so definitely compatible with grand theft auto vice city. Yet bubble Witch Saga is not. Really?"}

I wouldn't have even noticed it if it hadn't popped up as a free ap. I like it on my older Kindle Fire because it tells me which aps are using battery power and what percentage. You do have to select advanced and then usage. On my 8.9\" Kindle Fire HD the usage just takes you to the device page. I'm uninstalling it on the Fire HD. The AP doesn't do a lot. One reviewer complained about the BAT/AC/USB that is under the battery on the page when you open the ap and says that the AC and USB don't work. If you plug the kindle in to AC, the AC lights up. So I guess that tells you that it's connected to AC. Barely worth the time to install. It does seem from other reviews and putting it on 2 devices that the features don't work the same on all devices. I don't think it's worth 99 cents."}

But when I attempted this same on myKindle Fire (Previous Generation)it was unplayable :(There were no adware, spyware or questionable permissions to report.

The story is good and the puzzles too, but the taps aren't always on so you might tap an object in a scene, get no response, move on, then have to double back to get the object which is really irritating. The forward and back buttons are also glitchy, and now I am near the end and stuck. I need to go back to a power station to turn it on and  the back button does not work, so now I can't complete the game.The hint button is another source of frustration. You can't get a hint in most mini-games without the hint either completing the puzzle for you or not working at all. When you are not in a puzzle the hint does not work at all to hint a direction like  most other games of this type. There's an 'eye' button, but that just illuminates the forward and back buttons and areas to search in a room, but those areas already sparkle so that button seems pointless.I usually love Big Fish games, so this one was I big disappointment.

When I finally got it installed (a torturous process at best) it was so slow it literally took minutes to switch to the next block of videos after pressing the buttons. It was only after I installed a 32 GByte SD card in my Wii that it operated smoothly. Next, there are the commercials that accompany every TV show you watch.

{"label": 0, "data": "I will keep this review extremely terse: this game is a complete rip-off of Zuma. All the developer did on this game is use the same graphics as those in the aforementioned and add a different name and title screen, as well as a different level-select screen and a different pause menu. In the pause menu, however, if you chose to quit the current level, the app automatically closes itself out. Most importantly, the controls are bad and the aiming is slightly off. Another important thing: This game has no sound whatsoever! (I played this on a Kindle Fire HD.) If you want a better Zuma clone to play, I recommend a game that was an FAOTD over a month ago: that being Sparkle. It has better graphics, better controls, music, sound effects, and most importantly, does not rip off Zuma, although Sparkle is a clone of that aforementioned."}

{"label": 1, "data": "I wasn't sure about needing this app as I already have the Log Me In Ignition, but I sure am glad I did! This app is super simple to set up for home connection and for away connection all you need is a Gmail account. I was really impressed by the speed of the connection. I was actually able to watch a video with sound and minimal to no lag. This cannot be done with the Log Me In Ignition app which has a lot of lag an no sound through put.To clarify, I will be keeping both apps as they each have very specific purposes. The reason LMII has lag is because the connection is encrypted, which would be important for some obvious tasks and it also has the ability to keep the host computer screen blank so someone can't peak at whats on your screen. Splashtop is fast and supports sound which is great for other obvios tasks that do not require encryption.Only docked one star for not being able to keep the host screen blank, but other than that a very good app, well worth whatever price they are asking."}

{"label": 0, "data": "This is a hidden item game.  In this one, you are tasked at finding numbers hidden within photos.  It has good artwork and is a unique twist on the genre that has flooded Amazon Market.  Unfortunately, that ends the PROs.  The CONs are much more numerous.  The numbers are not very well hidden, making the challenge almost non existent.  The sound is unbearable at best.  The reaction to touch is laggy and often takes multiple tries to respond.  If you tap an already found number it glows as if it were new, making it hard to distinguish which are already found.  Lastly, I was forced to stop playing after a few levels because one number was off screen on my Kindle Fire.  No matter what I tried I could not complete the level due to this issue.  In the end, I would recommend this game to fans of hidden object games age 5+ who would rather seek numbers than items, and have a big enough screen not to suffer the issues I did."}

As others have said, I initially had an issue w/the game booting me out at the sub. I didn't have to reinstall the game. I left the sub area & worked on puzzles in other areas of the game, before exitting the game. Then, I rebooted my Kindle to clear the cache. After that, it worked fine. Not sure if clearing the cache did it or that I'd found the sub parts prior to my last attempt. Either way, I didn't have to start the game over in order to fix it, which was great. I highly recommend this game if you're looking for a good, classic point & click game w/no HOS."}

I love the little faces on the blocks as you play and the strategy for each level may take you a few tries to figure out.

Other levels require you to time your moves and use the motion and physics to your advantage. This is a well thought out game!Unfortunately the developer left in multiple permissions that they have no need for. He obviously took out OpenFeint (He states this on his app page on Amazon) as we all now realize how that is really a form of spyware (You share your game scores but what else are you sharing) but he left in:* Network communication - Full network access* Kindle Calls - Read Kindle state and Identity* Network communication - View network stateThis game is 5 stars but due to the remaining permissions which still leave open access to my network and Kindle data I cannot in good faith give it more than 2 stars.

There is a timer but it's not too detrimental to the gameplay.3. Does promote logical thinking skills.4. Does give a rating but again not detrimental to gameplay.5. Because of decisions made by the player such as use of timer and excellent rating the developers have let the player decide &quot;their&quot; game. Most games are the other way around; the player is locked into the developers' way of playing with little flexibility.5. Permissions are reasonable.Cons1. Currently I have not encountered any.Thank you for a great game. I will look for other games made by these developers."}
{"label": 1, "data": "Before I got my kindle, I played this game on my sister's kindle and was immediately addicted. Since getting my own kindle, the addiction hasn't changed. I like the randomness of the dice, just like if you were playing the game for real and the sound they make. Sometimes I wish there were more variations of the dice, but that's only when I'm losing. What's frustrating the most is when I'm in the middle of a game and the game freezes up. I don't know if that's the game or the kindle itself. I'm thinking the game since I don't have any problems with other games or apps. Otherwise, I'm extremely satisfied with the playability and format of this game. If you haven't played this game yet and you like dice games like Yatzee, try it, you'll like it too."}

According to others posting here, the dev put ads in the update and completely borked the game making it unplayable for many. Way to go.Original review-Plays good on my Optimus S except for the audio when you crash into a wall. Not real laggy either. Game play itself is fine but I'm running reborn rom and overclocked.Too prevent the screen from going to sleep while you're playing, just go to settings and set the display time out for 10 minutes. Just remember to change it back when done playing.Other then the audio (when u crash), and the screen timing out during game play, this game is definitely worth trying."}

The few puzzles were very easy, and the storyline was not much more than a thin frame to hang the hidden object searches upon.The &#34;key object&#34; twist did make the hidden object searches a bit more interesting but not enough to make me want to play the sequel.Kudos for the artwork which is beautiful, and the background music which helped set the scene for each search.

I believe we've already covered discussions of what sticky intents are in reviews of other apps. If you're unsure of what they are and what they do, search for those discussions in reviews of other recent apps. Basically, stickies are an UNSECURE way of broadcasting data over an internet connection, which this app ALSO wants your permission for.Sticky intents being unsecure, making data available to other apps that may not have a need for that information, as well as the disguised mention of possibly necessitating the download of Adobe Air for this to even run, make this app a bloated risky one that I cannot recommend. The Air issue aside, stickie intents alone make this app something you should never download, and many concerned developers don't even want to include it for that reason.

{"label": 1, "data": "The Good: Improved visuals, varied environments, a few new weapons, still feels like a solid shooterThe Bad: Poor AI, visuals aren't up to par with the hardware, multiplayer feels boring after awhile, too similar to the last gameThe first game really showed that military shooters/Call of Duty clones can be done right on the iPhone. Black Pegasus was highly anticipated, but in my eyes doesn't really do enough to make it truly amazing. There are a lot of improvements such as visuals, handling, but it really is just mostly visuals. The same weapons exist with a couple of new ones, the story still continues with the absurd plot of Abu Bahaa (really?) doing his terrorist antics, but he is never seen in this game. Instead you track down his lackeys, but Gameloft tries to be clever and start the end of the game first, make you play the middle, then meet up to that level at the beginning. It doesn't work Gameloft and you are lousy at storytelling!Gameloft used to be good and fanboys will cry how amazing they are, but most Gameloft games are cheap high budget looking games and they spend almost zero time making it something amazing. Most games are rip offs of better successes and Black Pegasus is clearly one as well. Why do I continue to play them? Because they are the only really higher budget looking games on the app store. Anyways, the graphics look good, but not up to par, say, like Infinity Blade, but they are a huge improvement over the first game. The controls are a little more intuitive, the environments are more varied with snow, jungle, and less desert and indoor areas. However, the art style is bland, and it really just feels like Modern Combat 1.5.Of course a game like this is all about the multiplayer and it works, it will keep you busy, but not for very long. There are map packs to buy, but multiplayer doesn't really work like consoles do on mobile phones due to either the controls that don't allow such quick precise aiming, auto-aim, or other issues. Go ahead and pick this up it is a solid shooter, but AI problems, and other issues above will keep it from being amazing."}

The characters in the game are just horrible. Real pictures of people with one facial expression and only a mouth moving. It was painful just to watch. I usually ended up clicking past the conversations and ignored parts of the very weak attempt of a plot. The games themselves were okay. Nothing overly hard, a couple frustrating parts when the order of things that you needed to do wasn't clear. I finished the game fairly quickly and I'm not really that upset because I was getting tired of hearing the main characters whiny voice say &quot;let me help you find that!&quot; There really isn't any replay value with this game so you'll have to decide if a few hours of a painful plot is worth the few bucks. For me, not so much."}

Some shows didn't have all the episodes available(like 1-7 would be there, then 8-9-10 not, then 11 & 12 are...really?). Lots of still shots during episode play while the dialogue was still going. Another kicker...you could only watch Hulu on one device at a time. My 8 yr old wasn't happy w/the movie & TV choices offered. Lots of back-in-the-day choices though(if you're into that).

{"label": 1, "data": "Especially for free. Several different types of leaves to jump on, all with different properties, multiple types of enemies, endless kinds of items... the list goes on. There are several parts that require different strategies, too, which switch up the gameplay. For example, a part in which there are no platforms at all... you have to collect a feather, which gives you flight for a short time, and when that runs out you must get another. To give just one example.Especially for this type of game, such variation is rare. You usually get one character, in one background, jumping on one platform, avoiding one enemy. In Pepe, you can even collect apples, which can then be redeemed for new character or backgrounds. In short, it is Simply Amazing. If you want an endless jump-up game -- get this one. You won't be disappointed."}

{"label": 1, "data": "This is a physics game. It's very simple and very original in its simplicity. Mr. AahH swings on a rope from pedestal to pedestal. The pedestals are of varying widths; each successive pedestal is lower than the one before it. Your job is to tap the screen to tell Mr. AahH when to release the rope. Do it just right, you'll land in the red zone, earning you extra points. At some stages, you have to compensate for wind and gravity changes.I found it quite compelling. It's a bit repetitious, but since you will eventually work through your three lives, the games don't last forever. The goal is to get ever increasing higher scores, like an arcade game.I loved that, when you just barely make it, Mr. AahH balances precariously on the edge for a second before backing up (or moving forward, depending on the edge). The game will tell you when you are late or just barely make it, and will give you a big &#34;Just!&#34; when you hit the red zone. I got to level G-2 and 12950 points on my third try, with two consecutive &#34;Just!&#34; landings. (It tracks how many consecutive Just! landings you have, not how many total in the game.You can apparently use the accelerometer to fine tune Mr. AahH's landings, but I haven't tried that yet.I'd give it a solid four stars."}

It's customer satisfaction. How am I supposed to even consider buying a PopCap game in the future when you aren't supporting me right now? Chuzzle was available a few weeks ago for free as well. Downloaded and installed on my Droid, then nothing. It never worked and even worse, I couldn't uninstall. Thankfully I had a nandroid image from that morning so I could restore. So Far PopCap is 0-2 on Android for me. Such a shame as they have great desktop games.Oh and for all you folks who just got their Incredibles/thunderbolts, etc. This is standing up for you as well because in less than one year you will be in the same situation Original Droid owners are in now. Your phone will be 1 -2 years old and no longer supported. So rather than call us whiners, you should be vocalizing that you don't want the same thing to happen to your device.

There are ways to spend real world $$ but you don't have too, it is unnecessary to enjoy the game.This is unique.

My router blocks those ad servers so I have no idea what it would look like normally.  But for me, it just throws up a blocked web page that I have to close to read my article.  That can happen dozens of times in one session depending on what I'm trying to read. Can't they embed ads into the app itself?"}

Populus Romanus has more scenarios [battle maps], plus a duplicate set of scenarios playing the opposing side. PR2 has fewer maps, and you only play the Roman side: no playing the game from Celts' side, defending Britannia from the invading Italian hordes. If you like PR1, you're better off spending your hard-earned FRNs on _War Games of 1939_ from the same publisher, which at least has more maps and has added the ability to play them as the defender.So, only 2 stars until such time as the game gets the extra play options that will at least get it close to the standard established by PR1."}

The reason for this is the multitude of comments stating that downloading said update causes you to be unable to get into the app.  I will change the review back to 5 stars if I see the developers description of the app's update includes a fix to this problem, as well as believable customer reviews that reflect the problem has been fixed satisfactorily.  Therefore, 2 stars for the app for at least the old download working, and minus 3 for not having the latest version and hanging around my Update section of the Amazon Appstore app unnecessarily.PRIOR REVIEW:  This is definitely one of my favs!  I took some simple one-click photos right from the app that were probably suitable for framing! (If I can send to laptop and enlarge them).  The photos are THAT GOOD!  Black and white sketches are MUCH BETTER than similar features on desktop apps that distort your face up and put black blobs in some areas. You dont even need to play with those shadow angles like on desktop apps. Im in love with that Bleach feature... its awesome!  Download and see, you will NOT regret! :)"}

Allows you to make margin notes and bookmark passages.  The scriptures are numbered but each is not a new paragraph (narrative form like a novel).  Does allow you to return to previous passages without referencing the history section.  For the price, excellent buy; however, don't discard your hardback.

As you complete a task, and Mark it off....it tracks the percentage of your completion.  OK.  The chore lists include daily things such as mAking beds and washing dishes....being scored at the same time as annual things such as cleaning out your closet and donating extra clothes to charity.So, if I take the dog to the vet and clean my chimney today, I have the rest of the year to get around to making my bed once this year?  If I mop my bathroom floor, vacuum, dust, and wash the dishes only once per year, I could score a 100% clean house for the year.Once you cross out things such as cleaning your dishwasher, flipping your mattress, and cleaning under your refrigerator....those things you don't do every day, but don't really recall when you last did them....you have no idea when to do them again.

It was after doing some research on the internet and other things that I did some tweaking and reinstalled the program I have it working.I am only giving it a 3 because of the customer response.

It's only a dollar, so I can't really complain, but I think the game would've been better if it was longer and maybe priced a little higher to compensate. I just feel like it was only half of a game, like they could've done a lot more with it.The puzzles were often too easy, but occasionally far too obscure to notice the connection between the hint and the puzzle. They have a built-in guide to help you in those cases, so it's not necessary to leave the game for outside help. And if you REALLY can't figure a puzzle out, you can have the game solve it for you, so you will never be stuck on a puzzle.No bugs to report, never froze/crashed, etc. All in all, a pretty decent app. Could be made into something better though.

All my books! Each & every one of them! So frustrating! I've contacted support about this twice for no answers. My sister's has done the same thing several times as well.Also I understand that Kindle users have the option of categorizing or organizing their books - wish we with the app could do that too. To mark them as read, unread or make a note regarding the book. Also to be able to leave a review for a book directly from the app as opposed to logging into Amazon to do so.We have no way to remove the books from our device once they are downloaded. They just continue to clutter up the device unless you choose to delete them entirely from your Amazon library. Some books that's ok for but then some books you might want to keep & loan out but not have them remain on your device.I noticed we have not had an update on the app since 2011...please give us categories, a way to mark them, option to remove books from device & leave in our library, a way to leave a review on a book without opening a browser & getting to Amazon and fix the bug that causes the app to move our books to Archive without our permission!"}

I love this genre and am always on a search for a new one but I have never paid more than $2.99.  I haven't been impressed enough by the lite or free version of the few more expensive games out there that I've tried to pay the higher price- including this one.

{"label": 1, "data": "I purchased this game many months ago and played it for quite a while.  While I liked it I found myself stuck about  of the way through the game and I could not finish.  The mystery gets pretty difficult and because of that I stopped playing.  Once you don't play a game like this you really sort of forget all of the nuances of the game and most of all the map of the land you are in and where you saw something that you now need to go get or use in the game. The graphics were good and the game was fun to play until I got stuck.There are several Cryptic Caverns walk through guides available on the web that I didn't use.  I hate to use them but with the difficulty I experienced in this app I probably will start playing it again from the beginning and use a walk through when I reach the end of my patience.Based on my experience the puzzle mystery game is just OK.  I enjoyed playing it but since I couldn't complete it I can't say that I love it.  Since I purchased the game because I like this type of genre I would probably purchase it again, but just be aware that it is not an easy game to beat.  It is only $0.99 and I got that much fun out of it the first time I played it. I have played better games and I certainly have played much worse.  As I mentioned, I did find the graphics design to be well done.The game uses Flurry Analytics and it has Facebook developer tools installed into the game.

While I do wish there was maybe some nice relaxing music in the background, it comes in handy sometimes that it's quiet. I've started up this game in a boring class at university, when my husband has been sleeping, and even when I've been talking to that *one* customer on the phone that never stops talking, all without fear of being caught (though I always have my phone or tablet on silent when in class or at work.)There are only 2 permissions, and neither of them have any way off trying to steal your information, which is another VERY nice thing in today's day and age.So, overall, fun little time killer that there's no fear of it stealing your information.

{"label": 1, "data": "Device Tested: Kindle Fire HD 7\"This is an okay game. It's a simple quest style platformer game, and it seems to have a pretty decent story in my opinion. And with no permissions and only a handful of reviews so far, I thought it'd be worth the time to check it out.Here's my assessment so far:- As the title says, the graphics are mediocre. They're very pixelated, sort of like Super Mario Brothers, only SMB had a better drawing style to it. This game seems to have a pretty poor drawing style. Don't get me wrong, it's decent enough that you can tell what everything is for the most part - except in the very beginning, where the cow you're supposed to feed looks like a giant green blob. That being said, they still could be better.- The controls are fairly decent for the most part. They take a bit getting used to,and they're kinda small (Phone owners, this game definitely won't be for you). However, once you get the hang of how to move and jump, it's easier. The only other thing I have to say is that the response time could be improved.- The sounds are decent. Once again, you'll be reminded of Super Mario Brothers when you jump, because the sound is similar if not identical to the sound that Mario makes when he jumps. That might get a little annoying, but then that's what the volume control on your device is for. The music is bearable, but not all that great.- The storyline is pretty cool, and I've found that by tapping the screen, the dialogue bubbles can be sped up. The dialogue itself isn't very original, but it doesn't drag on and is kind of helpful at times. The concept behind the storyline is a little too overused in my opinion - weakling has to go out and prove his worth by doing everything that the stronger people are trying to do.All in all, I give this game a 3/5. It's an okay game, but it's likely to be deleted from my device as it's not all that eye-catching. The lack of permissions aren't really enough of a justification to add an extra star, so this is where my review stands for now. I would recommend this game to people with larger screens, not phone users, and I wouldn't recommend it to someone looking for good quality gameplay.- Sam"}

You have to collect many free bonus's or buy coins, which I won't do, to play for any length of time.  The one thing that it took me awhile to realize (ok, so sometimes I can be unobservant) was that the golden chests you get after completing a level renew every 24 hours. This is a MAJOR source of points once you've accumulated several levels but it requires you to scroll through the worlds and to not spend a lot of time doing it you need to coordinate claiming the bonus so you can do it all at once."}

{"label": 0, "data": "There are 3 HUGE problems with this developer and their app.1. Money, you can't do much in this game unless you get upgrades. The problem is upgrades are RIDICULOUSLY expensive. For exampleUnlocking a new vehicle 800 coins1st upgrade 1600 coins2nd upgrade 5000 coins3rd upgrade 10000 coins4th upgrade 20000 coinsHere is the problem with that I loaded this freshly onto a new tablet. To get that first purchase of 800 coins took 10 games with an average gain of 73 coins per game.So how many times do you need to play to get the next upgrade (1600pts) well if your getting 73 coins per game that's an additional 22 times to play the game.What this means is that you pretty much MUST buy a coin doubler at a cost of $1.99 just to get ANYWHERE with this game.So what upgrades do you need?Lets seeCoin Doubler $1.992000 coins $.995000 coins $1.9910000 coins $2.9925000 coins $4.99100K coins $9.99So what do you buy with that many coins?1. boost 5 levels starting at 200 going to 20000 coins2. Shield 5 levels starting at 200 going to 20000 coins3. Coin Magnet 5 levels starting at 200 going to 20000 coins4. Coin Bubble 5 levels starting at 200 going to 20000 coins5. Checkpoint 5 levels starting at 200 going to 20000 coins2. Repetitiveness. The game has 4 \"scenes\" The familiar beach scene, a jungle scene, a fire/ volcano one and a frozen ice land scene. You race through them trying to get to the next checkpoint. There is no pre laid out route. The scenes change in the order that they appear as you race through them but the core really never changes. So basically you are racing the same little mini scenes over and over and over they just appear in random orders.3. Not beatable. I'm usually a really good race game player. But I can't get past 45%. I still play it from time to time but have pretty much given up on it as the repetitiveness has worn on me.ConclusionSo my point to all this is: IF you are collecting 200-300 coins per game, This is a total JOKE when upgrades cost 10000 coins! I bought the $5 pack and a coin doubler and REFUSE to buy more. I now play the game a few times a week but its not really getting me any farther in the game.So its fun but don't get suckered into buying coin pack after coin pack"}

{"label": 0, "data": "IMPORTANT NOTE: Amazon mentioned that WorldCraft from Solverlabs was the free app of the day on July 3rd through their Amazon App Store Twitter feed.  I assumed it was a slight mix up and that WorldCraft would be the free app of the day later this week, but apparently Amazon is totally unaware that they mentioned the wrong app being the free app of the day and it appears now that WorldCraft won't be a free app of the day at all now.  Sorry for the confusion I might have caused about WorldCraft possibly being a free app of the day later this week.Today's Amazon App Store Free Paid App Of The Day for July 5, 2013 is Cubimania from The Hohng Company.This is a 3D Tetris-like game.  The object is to simply stack as many 3 like colored blocks next to each other either horizontally or vertically.  The game as it is now is playable.  The controls are somewhat poorly laid out on the screen and take a little while to get used to.  I also didn't like the fact that there are 2 yellow types of blocks instead of adding another color such black or orange.But the biggest problem with this game is that it is one of those games you will have totally forgotten about in a month if not sooner than that.  There was nothing to keep my interest in this game after I made it to Level 3.  There are no new special power cubes that destroy others around it like you would find in a game like Bejeweled.  Level 2 and 3 seem to be just a continuation of Level 1.  The graphics are below average.  The written text such as the \"play again\" and \"stop\" that appear after finishing the game look like an amateur programmed this and are hard to make out the words if there are colored cubes of about the same color in the spot where the text is printed.Another major problem with this game is the lack of being able to play this game \"Chess\" style like Tetris where the next piece is shown in advance while you are placing the piece falling on the screen. If it had this feature like Tetris does, it would give you a chance ahead of time to figure out where to put the following piece.  This feature being omitted takes away a good deal of the strategy element to a Tetris-type clone like this.Because the game is playable, but is below average in both graphics and playability and is one of those games you could easily forget about, I am giving this a 2 star out of a 5 star rating."}

{"label": 1, "data": "This is actually pretty cool; it includes two workout sets and workouts can be 5 minutes, 7.5 minutes or 10 minutes.  There is a video of each exercise, a timer and a description.  Workouts can be paused, and if you exit the routine and come back you can start with a specific exercise.I think it works best in portrait mode, at least at first; you can see the description of the exercise as well as the video, and the video size doesn't get that much larger in landscape mode.The only setting available is sound; and the only sound is the video trainer announcing the name of the exercise video at the beginning of each exercise.  You can start an MP3 playing before starting the app and beginning the routine and have it play while you workout.After working out with the app:  Nicely done, the video along with the description underneath is very helpful.  The name of the exercise is announced as an audio cue, the video demonstrates two or three reps of the specific exercise and then Ready, Set, Go appears at the top of the screen.  I think it would be better if Ready, Set, Go was also an audio cue, but that's a minor quibble.  The amount of time remaining in each exercise and the number of exercises yet to go is also shown.  Note that the routine might last only five minutes, but these aren't necessarily easy exercises.It would be nice if turning it to landscape resulted in a larger video...I would give it five stars if that were possible.You can do workout 1, workout 2 or a custom workout routine that you create.When you've finished, you get an audio cue of \"Workout Complete\" and a rousing round of applause."}

{"label": 0, "data": "PROS: The application loaded fine on my Velocity Cruz. If you like surprises as you draw, you'll be pleased to know that each time you lift your finger and then touch it back to the screen, you'll be drawing with a different color. You may also randomly select a background color which can be changed at any time without obscuring what you've already drawn. The lines draw smoothly and consistently. You can undo without limit and access easy save and exit options. CONS: You have no predictability and no choice in brushes. The random color selections go on what seems like endlessly, so you can't easily cycle back to a color you like. Worst of all an the reason I scored this app so low, unlike any other app I have, the touch of my finger and where something is generated on the screen are too significantly apart for me to create what I intend no matter how consistent I was in trying to compensate. Nonetheless, if you're just fooling around, it's okay - just too frustrating for MY fingers."}

{"label": 1, "data": "I watch my share of Netflix movies.  I'm an Amazon prime member and watch 95% of my movies with Amazon.  My main reason for paying to keep a membership with Netflix are such shows as, LilyHammer, and Orange is the new Black etc.,I'm hooked on the many Netflix Original Series  and for $8 bucks a month you can't go wrong.Netfix has many movies available that aren't on Amazon and vice-versa.  Also with Netflix, they don't charge you to watch individual episodes after you get hooked on a series...For instance, I watched Breaking Bad Seasons 1-4 on Netflix.  Had I watched the seasons on Amazon I would have been charged a small fortune for each episode in that season.Amazon needs to remedy how their members watch all season and episodes on shows that have multiple seasons. Do they not know Netflix offer's all of them for just the minimal monthly membership fee??The only downfall to  Netflix is, most of the newer movies are only available on their DVD mailing membership program. I don't return rentals that responsibly so that's out!Amazon is better if you ask me! Especially being a Prime Member..Netflix is running a close second.The Netflix  app. works awesome, no pop-up ad's, and is user friendly.  You get a 30 day free- trial membership just in case you want to try before you buy.  in addition, if you want to cancel your subscription.  It's hassle free..No chasing anyone down to cancel it.  Customer Service is amazing..Would highly recommend.P.S. Of course Amazon Prime has multiple perks Netflix will never have."}

IMO...The controls are nothing to master at least for me, I only ran 3. 3 lap races before I beat it, Other's mentioned that mastering the sharper curves were a problem for them, that maybe so for a smaller child but going around any of the curves were easy.The main problem I had was learning to stay away from the other bikes, Once I got past them it was easy and quite frankly \"MIGHTY BORING\", There was no challenge after that as none of the other bikes were a threat after I got past them.The Turbo Boost was also a joke.While you did speed up \"SLIGHTLY\" it was like you were in a Slow Motion time warp as you were speeding up.Even if you waited to kick it in as you were just beside another bike it was like you sped up from a normal walking pace, To a fast walking pace, Instead of running.I don't even see how this would hold the attention span of an average child for that long.And one last thing if you were to run one of their 9 lap races, Be prepared to be \"MIGHTY BORED\" while going past at a \"SNAILS PACE\" all of the as one person here said Cardboard Cutout Figures in the stands.The Music is also worse then stinks.I'm just Glad I got it as the App of the day.Or I would be asking for a refund real quick.Even at .99 cents it's a \"RIP OFF\"....There are much batter games here for .99 cents that you can spend your money on.Take it from me it just isn't worth it Download Time and or Money Wise...."}

{"label": 0, "data": "Here is a funny story. So I've played Hanging With Friends a long time on my android phone and I paid to remove ads a while back. I got a Kindle Fire 8.9 HD, and figured due to resolution issues I'd try to stick to apps out of the proprietary Amazon app store which are specifically formatted for the Fire. I installed the Hanging With Friends app and tried to pay to remove ads. It doesn't work, and I've went through this long dialog with the guys at Zynga customer support which was completely unsuccessful. I just can't get rid of these stupid ads even though I'm willing to pay whatever for it. They just give me coins, tell me to uninstall and reinstall the app endlessly, ask for screen shots of the ads, and say they'll forward the problem to the development team. So I decide I have nothing to lose and uninstall the Amazon version of HWF (again), create a backup apk with ES File Explorer on my phone of the Google Play version, transfer it to my Fire with my PC, and install it. Here's the funny part: It works flawlessly. I don't have ads and the kicker is that it actually looks better on the Fire then the Amazon version! What the heck? Why don't you guys just release the Play store version on the Amazon store? I can figure this out, but I'm sure other people are stumped and frustrated with this problem. Do you want an inferior version on the Amazon store? And I've since uninstalled the Amazon version of Words and Scramble With Friends and side-loaded the Google version of those on my Fire to remove ads which option you don't even have for those, and they seem to work flawlessly as well. I'm just letting you know you're making this a lot harder on your customers than it has to be."}

I want to point out too that if you want to get the id problem out of the way and for searches once you enter the id then don't forget to tap the key at the downright corner to make it work. What I'm saying is that those fatal flaws takes too much time away from the gameplay. Excellent game but gamevil didn't try to cover over the flaws at all on this game.Maplestory is better with their programmings than gamevil. In Maplestory you can chose how many of one type of item to drop not sell.But this game can't do that and what with the scrolls for different classes now couldn't they have done what they did in the third game.I just can't take it any longer with the heavy burdens."}

Decent wins started showing up a couple of weeks ago and the game was fun again.  Now this morning they have &quot;updated&quot; again. I do not want to play in their tournaments.

I don't really mind because I don't play it for more than 10 minutes at a time but for some people, this would be annoying. Also highly recommended is an oregon trail gameplay commentary by Penguinz0 on youtube. It is hilarious but just a warning - it does use some profanity.

{"label": 0, "data": "I got Pumped: BMX as the free app of the day today from Amazon.I attempted to play this game for quite a while today and could never get the hang of it.Here are the reasons why:1.  The controls are awful and the game seems to lag at times.  You have to hold down the pump button most of the time to go forward in the game.  You can't give your finger like a second or two break or you miss the timings of the jumps.  And when I went to press the pump button a few times, the pump button did not respond by turning a black color like it does when being used which is a problem which I will discuss in #2 below.2.  This game is rather extremely hard from the beginning.  There is absolutely no room for error in your jumps.  If you land wrong, you lose any momentum to make the following jump and the game is designed so that you can only make each consecutive jump by landing and accelerating perfectly on each jump.  This game really needs some difficulty settings such as easy or hard and completely lacks any.In addition to the poor controls and the extremely hard gameplay, I found the music to be cheesy and rather repetitive.Unless you don't get frustrated when playing a game that is almost impossible to complete each level, I would not recommend this game.Because of the control issues, the rather extreme timing nature of this game making it nearly impossible to complete any of the levels starting right from the very first level, the lack of difficulty settings, and the cheesy music, I am giving this game only one star out of five."}

If I find I need to, I will downgrade it later.Right now we are watching a slideshow of all those pictures I had on my phone for the last couple of years.  Having so much fun seeing them on the big screen.Even though I may come back and update this later, I wanted to put this info out while it is FAOTD to add some info that might help somebody.1.  Like other posters have said, you DO NOT have to log into Facebook.  I use FB, but not on my phone, so I'm not logged in.2.  At first I could not get it to work.  The app said it couldn't find my Vizio smart tv, and from the TV I could see the Pantech Marauder phone, but could not select any pictures or video.  I was able to play one of the videos provided in the app, but I really wanted to see my own pics.  I even wrote to the support people (there is a nice contact us type section in the app), but in the next 5 minutes, I found the problem and wrote to ask them to close the support ticket.All I had to do was restart my phone, and now everything shows up in the app.  So if you are having trouble, restart!=====================================================Update (1/23/2013):  I'm downgrading this from 5 to 4 stars.I do love the ability to display my phone's pictures on my TV.  But when I wanted to show my husband some new pictures from a trip yesterday, it took me another 10-15 minutes to get the connection working again (not an easy process). I think the app-TV communication should be a little simpler. Unless it is more straightforward with some of the specifically listed compatible TV sets, I can imagine a lot of frustrated users, so I don't want to give it a false \"glowing\" review.I had a little trouble deciding between 3 and 4 stars.  Here's how it ended up as 4.  I rated some different aspects of the app.3 1/2 stars: The included videos are okay - nice to have them on the phone to kill some time.5 stars: I love to show my phone pictures on the TV - and I have gotten this to work both days that I tried it.2 stars: I strongly dislike how it is not a quick and easy connection.3 stars (neutral): I couldn't get the 2 videos I took yesterday to display on the TV.  (I'm not placing a lot of weight on this, since it could be a compatibility or user issue.)So my \"average\" is closer to 3 than 4, but I really do \"like\" this app. I'm just having some issues with it.  Since my Vizio is not specifically listed as \"supported\", I'll give the app the benefit of the doubt and assume it would work more smoothly with those televisions that are listed as supported."}

Suddenly you may discover that the game closes suddenly...and when you restart it all of your energy is gone! Plus there is a weeks worth of hours added to your building making it much longer and harder to collect. HINT- If this happens to you, allow twisters, floods and fires to damage your buildings and animals so that when you fix them they will reset. I reloaded this game after level 50 because of glitching...yet same glitches happen again. What I HATE about this game is that it never stops running! A very loud bleep will sound every time you open up your kindle, some times a few times. Even with sound off! Always the reminder to play the game.  If all this doesn't discourage you then when you do play...use your cash to buy the silver axe immediately! Its the most useful thing to acquire and it will save you twice the energy chopping.  The beepers just went off again twice. The game alarm interrupts every thing you do...even reading or surfing the net.  If this were fixed and it didn't runconstantly Id add another star.

It says garage, but from what I recall there is little more than painting, decorating, adding gas, and a few other small things. Multi-step repair of interesting parts of the car and engine would be much more appropriate for the title and to be in line with the rest of the series. It would also be great if the small driving area would change, every time it's the same hill, the same buildings, etc. Very limited even for a 99 cent purchase and definitely not worth 2 bucks.

Not only that, but when you successfully complete a quest, you aren't rewarded with enough energy to &#34;break even&#34;. I think if you successfully solve a puzzle, you should get back at least the amount of energy you invested in attempting the puzzle. On the bright side, the look and feel of the game is outstanding.

I also imagined it being like the little footballs you make it school and try to make between field goal posts made of fingers.

Most of the time they are stationary but sometimes they can move, too. You can earn bonus lives by hitting it in the right spot but it takes a lot of practice to get it in there consistently. You can only have three extra lives and then you start losing them. There are some advanced levels where three extra lives still isn't enough to get past them. But 95% of the levels are pretty simple.I enjoyed the challenge of the game, despite its simplicity in playing. There are other game modes you can play but the one I explained above was my preference. I played for several hours and have decided to keep it for passing a few moments when I'm bored.

Okay, now let's get down to business. When I first got this, I thought it would be fun, and i was dumb not to read these reviews. So I played the game and liked it enough that I kept it for a while. Haters of Talking Angela, keep reading, I hate her too. So then I slowly started to realize that yeah, her voice is creepy and robotic. She does act weird. She does order funny drinks. She scolded me for touching her and the sign behind her. So why did they put that on there? She does talk about love and fashion too much. No, she didn't cuss or say inappropriate stuff, but people that said she did, i totally believe you. So I read some of the reviews, and I was completely creeped out. I felt like the camera was watching me. I bet a thousand dollars that all the good reviews on here are fake and put there by the stupid, dumb, sick, horrifying company that made this poo! I deleted it, and I'm glad because I would still be under the &quot;spell&quot; of Angela. She was kinda weird and haunting. And she always sat in the same spot! I wish someone would sue this company for selling this nightmare! I highly recommend that you steer clear of this app. It's bad.

If it were more enjoyable then I might give less weight to the following concerns.After looking at the list of permissions I felt what it has is far more than it needs for this type of program.  There are a few possible reasons for this.  It could be they were left in accidently from when the program was being developed.  Or, it could be they were put/left there intentionally and the developer has no intention of taking advantage of they provide for gathering personal data without my permission.  Or, maybe they do.Also, with the questionable permissions that are there now, there is also the chance that a future update will grant additional access and increase the potential for personal data loss.  Unfortunately, I'm less vigilant of updates than during the initial download.In addition, this game took a very long time on the &#34;Loading&#34; screen. Could be paranoia but I have to wonder just what, the heck, it is doing.The above concerns remind me of something I heard about &#34;Free&#34; software, &#34;Sometimes (and all too frequently) when a product is free it turns out that *you* are the product.&#34;Faced with a game that isn't compelling and a bunch of risks, either real or imagined, I chose to err on the side of security and delete the app."}

{"label": 1, "data": "I'm a pretty critical reviewer, so this game probably deserves 5 stars.You use one of multiple races to build an army of various types of units, in an attempt to kill the enemy's army and capture their homebases. Each race has their own strengths and weaknesses. Each unit with each race has its own strengths and weakness. Land, sea and air units. All in all, a well stocked line up.Move your units through an octagon shaped grid (as pictured on Amazon) along various terrains. Each terrain type affects each unit different. For example, some units get attack and defense bonuses in the mountains...whereas other units can't even travel on the mountains. When an enemy is within attack range of your specific unit, let em have it. A small percentage is calculated which somewhat randomizes the amount of damage that will be done. Just so the exact same damage isn't done by the same unit every single time. Some units counter-attack when you attack them, some just defend. You can repair friendly units, teleport across the map, detonate EMPs, infect the enemy with toxin, convert enemy units into friendly, burrow units underground to travel undetected, and more.All in all, the gameplay is well done. There are three difficulty settings for the computer. Easy isn't super easy, but you'll probably beat most maps the first attempt. Medium is actually pretty darn tough. And hard is nearly impossible on most maps. There's little/no unnecessary animations to slow down gameplay. You can quickly move your units, attack, end your turn, skip over the enemy's movements and continue on with your next turn. I like this of course...... however... I would have liked to see some better graphics. This game is certainly not about graphics or anything fancy like that. It's about strategy. I get it. But still, the graphics are just ok. Very small basic units that do repetitive basic motions. To tell you the truth, I'm not even sure what I would add additionally... but I just feel it's a little lacking and that's why I knocked off a star. Maybe a little harsh. Give this game a 4.5 star rating."}

But there are a few minor issues which I will mention below.1.  On my device the timer at the bottom is cut off a little bit.2.  Music is a little repetitive.3.  Words are cutoff and split onto 2 lines sometimes.  It would have been nice when you solve the puzzle to have the letters on two lines come together on the same line during the fancy graphical reveal moment of the game.Even with those above minor issues and that the inclusion of more higher difficulty level puzzles would have been nice, I am giving this one 4 stars out of 5 stars since the rather nice app presentation and enjoyment of the game kind of outweigh those minor issues I mentioned above."}

{"label": 1, "data": "The &#34;enhancements&#34; to the game involve &#34;powerups&#34; such as dampening the effect of wild draw fours, getting a new hand at the beginning of a game (if you don't like the initial hand), mirror (if a player plays a draw 2 or draw 4 on you, they end up having having the same penalty), and others.  As you can expect, these powerups are purchased with in-game currency (which you can also earn but takes longer).  So some games end up being less about the luck and skill of the cards, and more about who has purchased (or invested) the most in powerups...which in some cases makes the game less fun.  Add to that a number of bugs (sometimes you get passed over for a turn, sometimes cards don't deal, sometimes you don't earn the points/coins for completing/winning a hand) and (in my own opinion) the lack of a single-player option in this version, and the game is fun...but has room for improvement.  I'd love to see an option where all players are prevented from using powerups."}

{"label": 0, "data": "Another hidden object game that is basically a generic game of that genre.  My virus software popped up a warning that the game presents a risk to my device because of its built-in ability to archive payment via SMS text messaging. It wanted to uninstall it.  When I stopped playing the game I was notified that the app continued to run in the background and I was asked if I wanted to Force Close the game.  In addition when the game was exited the audio special effects continue to make ticking sounds in the background when I was not playing the game. (Buggy software that is burning up my battery power) The game does take your device ID and reads your personal data, uses your WIFI and writes to your storage area of your device.On the Main screen, bottom of the screen, is a scrolling bar of games that they want you to download.  Touching them take you to the Amazon store with access to purchasing them so make sure that your children don't run up your credit cards.  You can turn off the WIFI and play the game on the Kindle Fire.In the upper RH corner is a series of buttons built into a graphic object.  They are:* Game options* Instructions* You can email the developer* There is a box that takes you to the developer's web site to buy more games.The game has 30 levels of play and they are locked and the only way to unlock a level is to finish the previous one.  There are also 3 mini games that are unlocked as you complete levels 10, 20 and 30 respectively.You can adjust the game difficulty by selecting the following modes:* Find objects by picture* Find by silhouette* Find by text description* Find by flashlight modeYou are awarded stars for completing the levels.  There is a hint button that takes 45 seconds to reset.  There is a pan and zoom function to help you find the hidden objects.  The objects are just scattered onto the background and they are sized and sometimes color blended to make them difficult to see at times.  The objects just look like they are placed by Photoshop and sized to be difficult to find or faded/re-colored to be difficult to find.  Some of the objects shown in the bottom of the screen to find are so small that I could not even tell what they were to find them.Overall the game is just a typical hidden object game of which I already have 25 of.  There is nothing spectacular about it.  I do not like that the Virus software popped up with a warning about archiving payments.  If it was not for the pop up warning from my virus software I would have given it a 3 star rating for a generic hidden object game.  With the pop up warning it is a 1 star."}

{"label": 0, "data": "I read the reviews before downloading the game. I agree that the five star reviews had to have been left be the developer/friends or people who have never had a race game before, or maybe any app for that matter. The only reason I rated this app as high as three stars is because I got it while it was the faotd. Had I paid for it, I would have been extremely upset and it would have gotten a much lower rating. This app is not anywhere near a five dollar app!  As a matter of fact .99 cents would be pushing it until they fixed a few major problems.The problems with the throttle and steering are the most obvious. First, it is very difficult to regulate the speed of the car. The amount of 'tilt' between slow and full speed is so slight it's very hard to maintain a constant speed while at the same time tilting the device side to side to turn. It just doesn't work.Second, the steering needs to be proportional to your speed. I noticed that while going slow and trying to turn, just a slight tilt slammed the front wheels one direction Or the other so you couldn't turn just a little.This game is ok for a starter, or a developers first attempt at a racing game, but it needs work and a HUGE PRICE REDUCTION!! If you want to play around with it, get it while it's free, but don't pay for this one unless you feel the need to throw money away and then beat your head against the wall after the purchase.Note to developer;please add proportional steering.Add the option to choose on screen buttons for steering and throttle/braking.Add an occasional chevron to the track surface so the operator knows what direction to go after a crash. Something like this (&gt;). It would be much better than having to look at the small track and/or wait for the wrong way message.Now, even if you fix all those things, you'd be hard pressed to get more than $1.99 for it. $.99 is much more in line for a race game of that caliber. a race game has to have EXTENSIVE options and tremendous capabilities before you can ask people to pay five bucks for it."}

{"label": 1, "data": "I enjoy playing this little time waster, sort of a time-management game. The problem is, first, I am constantly asked to upgrade (practically every time I open it), but there is never an update available. Second, it feels like the game is more concerned with the user buying gems and gold than providing game play. It gets a bit frustrating when you can only play for 5 minutes or so at a time, because to do it faster you need gems that the game will happily sell to you. I can understand paying a few dollars for a pro version (which for this game doesn't exist), but to play this game for any length of time you have to keep shelling out real money to buy the things that make the game 'hurry up'. I wouldn't mind paying (if interested) for items that make me advance to higher levels more quickly, but where I can't play the game at all after a few minutes, that seems like simply a way to generate revenue, not provide a creative gaming experience.Like I said, good little game, but hard to play with the limitations."}

{"label": 1, "data": "I use a lot of different battery apps and I was surprised by how much functionality this battery app provides. It also has a couple of minor drawbacks compared to my favorite battery app (Battery App by Elvison).The HD battery app has four pages of screens (you can switch between them by clicking on four dots on the bottom of the page) as well as 4 pages of settings (you can locate them by clicking on 4 icons at the top of any page).Page 1:The first page shows a large graphic of the battery with the remaining charge percentage. It also shows an estimate of much you can do on that charge: standby time, music playback, video playback, internet browsing, talk time. This information is based on community data, and you can calibrate it for your own device (under gear icon). Calibration made a big difference for me (details below).Page 2:It shows you(1) how much time it would take to fully recharge the battery using AC charge source or using USB charge source.(2) how much time you can use GPS without recharging or play Games (2D or 3D separately)(3) how much time you can use the device as a flashlight(4) how much time you can use the device for readingPage 3:Shows you how much you can use video chat, take photos, record video, listen to on-line radio, or do voice recordings.Page 4:This page shows battery health, technology of the battery, temperature of the battery, voltage, and time since last charge.Settings Icon:Shows the percentage of power used by each of the currently run applications (this is a short-cut to the same info as what you see under Settings of the device)Graph Icon:Shows the chart of your power usage on the grid that has percentage on y-axis and time of the day on x-axis.Gear icon:You can select battery color from a color wheelYou can select to show the charge level in the Notification Bar (for me this shows when I hit settings not on always visible notification bar)You can set how and when you are notified about charge levels. You can choose a ding or you can choose a human voice to tell you the level. My tablet emits lots of dings and sometimes I am not sure what it is trying to tell me, so having a voice tell me my battery is low is quite nice.You can choose to have the app automatically open when you start charging.You can run a set of tests which calibrate your tablet power usage rather than using the generic community data. This is a very extensive test - be prepared to give up the use of your tablet for 1 hour and 30 minutes. After calibration my estimates changed significantly: Music playing estimate went from 21 hour to 14 hours. Video playback froom 13 hours to 7 hours. WiFi from 8 1/2 hours to 4 hours.This is also where you can choose to upgrade to a pro version of the apps to avoid seeing ads (which are discretely displayed at the bottom of the page).SOURCE of Charge:I frequently use various battery apps to determine how my tablet sees the source of the charge (AC or USB). My favorite app for this is Battery App by Elvison. Elvison app shows AC, USB or discharging status. 'AC' status means the charging is at full charging rate. 'USB' status indicates charging at a lower charging rate. 'Discharging' status means that the charging rate is below the power that the device is consuming so it slows down the discharge rate but does not re-charge. It also shows me the time when it began charging.Battery HD app shows this information by displaying a graphic on the battery AC plug or USB connection. It does not show when the device is attached to the power source but is discharging because it cannot draw enough power to charge. HD battery does not show when the charging began.COMPARISON of results with the Battery App by Elvison.I decided to test this app using PowerGen PGMPP8400 8400mAh and PowerGen PGMPP9000 9000mAh external power packs whose performance I extensively tested with Galaxy 7.7. These external power packs have two USB ports labeled A (Apple) and NA (non Apple).Why are no all connections equal? Android devices use a USB Battery Charging Standard where as Apple devices use a proprietary USB connector. Because of this difference USB connections wired for Apple devices do not provide AC power to Android devices even when a charging cable (rather than the data cable) is used.Test Notes: (1) I kept the display powered on to make sure that powering display was the same in all tests as it is the biggest power hog.(2) I am using a charging cable rather than the data cable during the tests.Elvison Battery App: PowerGen PGMPP8400 8400mAh with Samsung Galaxy Tablet 7.7--------------------------Regular cable -- 0.6 AMP outlet -- ACRegular cable -- 2 AMP outlet -- dischargingHD Battery App: PowerGen PGMPP8400 8400mAh with Samsung Galaxy Tablet 7.7--------------------------Regular cable -- 0.6 AMP outlet -- AC iconRegular cable -- 2 AMP outlet -- AC icon (graph shows a flat line, no charge)*---*----*---*---*----*---*---*----*---*---*Elvison Battery App: PowerGen PGMPP9000 Samsung Galaxy Tablet 7.7-----------------------------------2Amp outlet ..... generic cable .... discharging .... 1% discharge in 10 minutes.06Amp outlet ... generic cable .... AC source ...... 1% charge in 10 minutesHD Battery App: PowerGen PGMPP9000 Samsung Galaxy Tablet 7.7-----------------------------------2Amp outlet ..... generic cable .... AC icon ...... 0% charge in 10 minutes (graph shows a flat line, no charge).06Amp outlet ... generic cable .... AC icon ...... 1% charge in 10 minutesOBSERVATIONS:Battery App by Elvison has three modes (USB, AC, discharging). HD Battery app shows USB or AC and then you need to look at graph to determine if the device is drawing enough power to charge. You will also notice this when the charged percentage does not go up.I am attaching a few screen shot that I thought might be interesting.#1. A screen shot with permissions requested by this app#2. A chart showing the power usage, note the flat lines which correspond to charging Galaxy 7.7 on Apple USB port.Overall, HD Battery app makes it a bit harder to see when am Android device is accidentally plugged into an Apple USB port and is not getting enough power. However the app provides a lot of other interesting information, I found this app a useful one to have on my tablet.Ali Julia review"}

The 'story mode' keeps track of your progress. Overall, not too bad.On a tablet, while the game supports nudging, it's probably not what you want to do. Other than that, the experience should be similar whether you play it on a phone or on a tablet.A couple of quirks that may be Honeycomb or tablet specific:- on some setup/config menus you can't exit and return to the game, must quit.- the auto landscape/portrait mode does not seem to work 'automatically' but if you specifically want to play in landscape it will- if you touch the wrong spot on your tablet screen you may see some config menu popping up and the only way out is by quitting the game- if you're playing on a phone, pay close attention permissionsInteresting features include the ability to create a profile for yourself, brag about your achievements on Facebook, invite friends, leaderboards - see warning on permissions above."}

One to fire the gun or swap weapons.  Both to move from side to side.Gets BORING real fast.  The graphics are akin to the old arcade version we all paid too many quarters to enjoy.  The sound is good.  The weapons are realistic.  It's just that all you do is kill animals with a tap.  Feels ultra LAME without a mock rifle in your hands.Pointless killing of animals gets tasteless real fast too.  If you want to know how Jeffrey Dahmer or H.H. Holmes enjoyed their leisure time, buy this game and play a while.My recommendation?  Go play a game in which you kill Nazi's or evil aliens--beasts that deserve death."}

{"label": 1, "data": "This app has 3 different activities: reading, spelling, and tracing. The reading is basically a matching game, matching the picture with the name under it to the empty box with the same name under it. The spelling game has the name spelled out with the same letters that you match to the spelled out name. The tracing section has the letters with circles showing the direction to trace. The only thing I didn't like about this activity is that it is sometimes frustrating for the children to trace it without going out of the shaded area. If you go out of it even a smidgeon, it makes you start over. The curved parts of the letter are sometimes hard even for me to follow. My granddaughter who just turned 4 got a little frustrated with it. She could get the straight lines fine, but the curved ones were harder. The graphics are cute and there is positive feedback when you do it right. Ages 3-6 would probably like this, depending on their readiness for it."}

{"label": 0, "data": "I'm a sucker for illusions - especially ones which appear to have motion, so I was very interested to see what this app had. I downloaded it and played with it on my Kindle Fire, and was quickly disappointed.Pro:+ Has a variety of categories of illusions, and several examples for each categoryCon:- For whatever reason, many of the illusions didn't work well on the Fire. Resolution? I've seen the same illusions (e.g. illusion of motion) on web pages on my PC and experienced the effect just fine. So, it's this app or the Fire's resolution.- The app is unreliable. If I click the power button on my fire to put it to sleep, when I come back the app is often unreliable, even if it wasn't the foreground app when I slept. I have to kill the App Hosting service to recover- One of the best things about these kinds of illusions is being told what they are and being surprised. For example \"the colors on this picture are the same for both the circles and the squares!\" and they don't look that way. I found no such narrative in this app.So, it doesn't run reliably on the Fire, and when it does run, the results are unimpressive. Despite being free, I wouldn't recommend downloading this app."}

Also, the speed of the game can be adjusted to make game play even quicker.The music on this game is repetitive, but you can disable the sound by touching the \"speaker\" option on the upper left and corner of the screen.The total memory space used by the app on my Kindle Fire is a hefty 31.14 MB. The graphics are indeed impressive, so I expected a high memory space usage.While the graphics are realistic and fluid, I found that I began experiencing some vertigo and sea sickness.  I may just be a wimp, but I don't know that I will play this game very often.  I don't think I have ever played a game that gave me a nausea type reaction.

{"label": 1, "data": "I was excited to see Rayman finally on the Android Os. For $2.99 it's an awesome price. There's one glaring issue with this game compared to the typical Rayman games. There isn't a storyline to follow. Jungle Run is just that a series of running puzzle maps where all you do is tap the screen somewhere to control a single aspect such as jumping or punching. You cannot really control Rayman in any other way. Sadly because of this the game loses almost all of its appeal rather quickly and becomes tedious after only a few amazingly short levels.  The game looks amazing and I did not experience any glitchiness in the control system or ability for the Fire to keep up.  For the price its ok but if you are like me and like the quirky stories the Rayman games have,  you would be better to save the $3.00 for something else."}

{"label": 0, "data": "The idea being the game is a good one but the execution is flawed. First, there is no easy way to gain pick axes and they are needed for many things.Second, each chore keeps the person handling it stuck there until it is completed. Normally that is not necessarily a bad thing since there are two others you can work with but when you plant crops it becomes an issue. You would think that each harvest process will be counted as a chore as a whole but that is not the case. Each plot is a chore itself. So if you plant twelve potatoes, for instance, which take two hours to grow you will have to wait two hours in between plots before you can move on to the next. The maximum amount of plots that can be done at once it's three before being asked to purchase more help which cost gold which is hard to come by.Third, there are constant pop ups asking you to purchase gold, pick axes and other resources. All in all I do not recommend it. It started okay so I have it a chance but definitely not a game I would recommend."}

After installing the app, entering my Comcast ID and password, and declining to use the parental controls, it was ready to go. Basically, the new app does what the old Xfinity player did, with one big new feature that many people have been begging Xfinity for: It streams live TV. For now at least, the live shows are mostly news and sports channels, but hopefully that's just a start. The live channels include Fox News, CNN, MSNBC, BBC World News, and several other news channels. Sports Channels include ESPN (it's actually just a link to the Watch ESPN app), Fox Sports, Golf Channel, and a few others. The National Geographic and National Geographic Wild channels are included. Note that the audio volume can only be controlled from your tablet, and there's an option to turn on closed captioning.Another very nice new feature is the ability to download some TV shows and movies onto your tablet and take them with you for offline viewing later. I haven't tried this yet, and it's not entirely clear to me how to find eligible shows, although there is a help screen.Overall, the app is a big improvement over the earlier Xfinity app that it replaces. Hopefully Xfinity will add more live channels, but for now, having a good selection of news and sports is a very promising beginning."}

The interaction is very basic almost to the point of not being able to call this app a game. Feeding and 'caring'; *click, click*, is the whole game. The only other aspects are purchasing furniture which is pre-placed and ridiculously pricey and buying equally expensive toys for which I have yet to see any purpose for, other than the satisfaction of knowing you own them. There is no ability to interact with any of the rooms or toys. So, in essance, it's a very simple game and which would probably suit a very young audience. But I was expecting that anyway, I didn't think the game was going to be some intense simulation action but it is a little too basic for my likes. I just wanted to make sure other people realized the scope of this 'game' before they bought it or downloaded it. The strange thing is though, that even with my disinterest in the app I still find myself going back to it again and again. If for nothing more the game does serve a purpose for me; feeding my obsessive desire to see how much money I can collect while completing each room and buying every toy. Haha."}

One more thing, on textplus sometimes when I'm texting the messages disappear for a second and it says: no messages available.

{"label": 0, "data": "This game is such a disaster on so many levels and is one of The worst dungeon crawler games I have ever played. First to play this game Thecle says it is free to play-yet not on Amazon though and even if it was- you need to purchase the premium license to get the gold loot to even have a shot and that is another story unto itself. Available on Amazon & G@@gle Play.. It sucks playing on Android, It Sucks playing on tablet, and even worse on Kindle Fire HDX. To start on the HDX the Game it self if you even move the tablet from a flat surface the game screen flips upside down, try turning the tablet it does the same thing. Not even the screen lock button helps. This alone makes the game virtually unplayable unless you keep it on a flat surface yet just one of the many things wrong with this game that just makes the playing experience un-enjoyable and annoying. Then there is the Game its self. I do enjoy good challenging game but this is a joke. You start out with absolute ZERO. You cant even get a basic beginners set of armor or weapons, The loot drops are pretty pathetic- either the item is a few levels to high to use or by the time you get around to being able to use it- it is barely useable for you already need the next items. the Gold drops are laughable- so bad because you despite going through a dungeon you get 1 or 2 gold pieces per loot drop which is not that many in a dungeon. So, when you try to purchase weapons, armor, Potions ect yet again so over priced they are you cant get purchase them and the farther you advance in the game the more expensive and ridiculous it gets. The Arena is the same way in price and like Russian roulette it is designed that you will fail every time and get nothing for your efforts.. The Graphics are decent and the music is ok which it about the only positive thing I can say for this game. The controls are clunky and not player friendly. The monsters in this game well just are silly looking. I have seen scarier looking monsters in old Final Fantasy games and the like than in this game. To top It all off is an inventory that is so bad and limited in capacity, and fills up so quickly that you have to lose good items, for if you try to purchase a potion that would transfer them in top storage- that right you got it- too expensive and even storage is extremely limited as well, which makes this game an epic failure in almost every way, In fact Im not sure the developers gave any serious thought in to making a proper challenging game- they just threw it all together as fast as they could and got it out there to make a quick buck and with Amazons Absolute Zero Return Policy- the player is screwed yet again.. Low and Behold Thickle has put out a part 2 to this game- Requiem and this time its free to play (on Amazon) but with all the same BS problems that plague the first game (except for the players that purchased a premium license in the first - then its just a sequel to a game full of problems) There are so many far superior games of this type out there Dungeon Hunter series, Dungeon Quest, Doom & Destiny, even the old Final Fantasy & classic pixel app games are better than this. So save your time, money and aggravation from one of the worst playing experiences of this game type ever to be released. Thicles games are some of the worst out on Amazon & Google that Id wish they would do all of us who enjoy games like this -just stop and go away. That is how much I can not stand Thecle games- they truly are THAT bad. A total waste of space on any device."}

{"label": 1, "data": "I spent a lot of time looking for an alarm clock app to use when traveling.  My phone alarm worked but... looking for something that may display the time, let me choose what song to wake up to, and would work even if I just set the alarm, and set it aside (would turn itself on and sound the alarm).I tried several free alarms, and none worked well.  This one you can go into settings and put on &#34;nightstand mode&#34; which will display the time.  You do want to leave that off if it is not plugged in, but I just plug it in when I am traveling and leave it on my night stand as a clock.  A swipe of the finger makes it brighter or dimmer.  Also shows the weather (temp and wind speed), which is a nice little added feature.  The free one does not allow you to do some of the things that the paid one does, so after trying the free one for a while, I did upgrade.  The free one does have an annoying thing of asking you to upgrade often (want two alarms, upgrade today, want to play your own music, upgrade today).I use this about once a week, and in the past 4-5 months I had either the alarm not sound, or slept through it once.  i was in a very noisy place, and I suspect that it may have gone off and I slept through it, but not sure.  If I absolutely, positively have to get up, I set a second alarm just to make sure, but I do that at home when I have something I have to attend the next morning.All around good app.  Has what I need, without a lot of extras I don't."}

Alternate players can be selected.OVERALL:A very Engaging and Entertaining Game that keeps your interest with enough Variety to avoid Boredom.  Not Aggravating or too Tedious like some other games of this type.  The only thing I DO NOT LIKE is the FLASHLIGHT MODE for hidden object searches result in your FINGER BLOCKING OBJECTS you search for. That could use a Fix to improve view.

{"label": 0, "data": "This is as bad as the Dumb or Smart test app with the never-ending repeating levels. Are these guys related? Also, I got a pop up ad for a new game of theirs that I had to interact with by X'g it off the screen, but that was when I closed the app and went back into it the second time. The third (and last time for me), it didn't do that. I wish they wouldn't advertise ALL ads removed and then pull that trick, it's annoying in a paid game.There should have been no need for the permissions, either, if they marketed it as a no-ad version, even if the ads are for their own products. All the Impossible apps, btw, are free on Google Play, here on Amazon they are for a price. I'm assuming Play has third party ads much worse than the popup I got off this one today, hence the free price, but they all have the same permissions as the ones on Amazon, go figure. There was a button for more games in this app, but I didn't click any of that, and will probably put the phones on airplane mode and no wifi next time we launch it. I'll be keeping an eye on any future updates should the kids want to download it again after I delete it.I give it two stars because it actually worked without glitches and you could turn the music off, but minus one for the ads/permissions, one for the lack of content, and one for the fail/game over business strategy. I'll have to take off the last star if they later sneak in Open Feint on an update (if that is why the permissions are still in this app, to get ready for that), just like their other Impossible Summer app already has incorporated into it on Amazon.But I digress, on to gameplay: Look devs, it's not anywhere near the word FUN to want to try a couple of other ways to accomplish a level after the couple of lives have been spent, only to get thrown back to the extreme beginning after completing a couple of dozen levels, especially when you're running a timer on me as well. Feels more like some sort of punishment than fun. We know you did that for the same reason Dumb and Smart test did it, to try to drag the game out 50 times longer than it really is rather than have us see that the game is really about 15 mins long, tops.If you don't want to put a bunch more content in it, fine, but don't try to give the ILLUSION of a longer game by making us spend most of our time repeating levels we already figured out. That's just wasting our time to add bulk and longevity to a game that just isn't there. Make it more interesting, like after a level, allow us to risk some of our points that we'd get the next puzzle right, like double or nothing. Sort of like Jeopardy does. Then we play to see how many points we can get, and if we bet high, it's our own fault for going back 10 levels or whatever. Or something else in between to extend the game, like word questions on Christmas trivia or something for extra bonus points (with a pause button!). Surely you can score 100s of those for free off the net and stick them in to add bulk.I don't know what else to say here except I can't spend all day on this app repeating mini games dozens of times to figure out the one puzzle in the middle of the game I got stuck on. It's not like you need BRAIN power or a genius IQ to finish them, either. Just have to know how YOU wanted us to accomplish the task, however disguised or uniquely weird it may be. Maybe later on I'll do what many others are probably going to do, just to finish this thing and be done with it, and that is look for a cheat or two from others who share their notes of how they solved the levels that others are stuck on. Then, sorry to say, it's going to have to be exiled to the Island of Misfit Free Apps of the Day where many do dwell."}

I thought the HOs were very good in that objects could be really hard to find. The puzzles could be pretty challenging but again, a reset button would have been greatly appreciated.

{"label": 1, "data": "Temple Run: Ozwas purchased and attempted onSamsung Galaxy Tab 2 (10.1-Inch, Wi-Fi)and I am pleased to report that the game does have some beautiful scenery & the original Temple Run game-play mechanics wherein one has to swipe up to jump and swipe down to slide to avoid obstacles along the path are still there which got these Temple Run series the much celebrated acclaim. The new scenery that this game adds is the sorta \"Occasional\" tilt-controlled hot air balloon sequence which in my opinion is pretty pleasing to look at and adds charm to the game.Thank goodness! despite the gorgeous new environment and graphics the frame rates do not suffer as much to cause annoyance. I still wish the developer takes feedback and adds some means to control the graphics quality to improve the frame rates little better so that it plays more smoothly just like the original Temple Run game.IMHO, The reason whyTemple Run: Bravedid not gain traction as much as the originalTemple RunorTemple Run 2is because of the poor frame rates one could achieve with the current tablets and phones out there on the market. Once a player sees the jittery of the character on the screen and cannot navigate by tracking your split second response the game-play gets boring.Having said, the bugging screens to download and install Dark Forest(Add-on Module) which is seen available as a free additional downloadable environment to run through in Temple Run: Oz annoyance is just too much to bear (not to mention additional download which works best with Wi-Fi only to avoid data download costs) early in the game-play. Get rid of that nagging screen just to get 3 free gems or include \"dark forest\" module as part of the game in the next update release and you have a winner game.Also out of curiosity why is this game not compatible with Kindle fire? is there a technical reason for it? or purely business!? I can tell you it works just fine on any Android based tablets (including KF) why is it not compatible with Kindle fire series? on Amazon? APP store. Fix that and I will rate this game with full five stars! just like the Original Temple Run.Cheers!"}

There were smoother scene transitions on my NES, and I know the kindle has more processing power than that antique.I would give the game five stars but for the fact that every time I try to play the Castle Under Siege stage, the app quits and takes me back to the Kindle's home screen. As it stands, I was able to play 20 or so levels, quite enjoyably. Fix the kickout issue, and you'll get your two stars back."}

{"label": 0, "data": "After playing and enjoying the original Seven Stars 3D game, this sequel came no where near my expectations. The main thing I did not like about it was that if you ran out of balls, you had to wait in the main menu for one minute to get an additional play (childish)! Some of the challenges they presented required the sacrifice of several balls to figure out, so having to wait a minute before continuing was frustrating. The other thing that was not up to par with the original version was the device tilting calibration for controlling movement of the balls. On a positive note, the graphics were excellent and the 3D presentation was very well done. I lost interest in the game before completing it."}

{"label": 0, "data": "Some parents are so concerned with a child's brain development that they buy expensive educational toys, videos, computers and language tapes. What does research suggest? Save your money. Too many new experiences or too much stimulation can cause stress and hinder a child's development. Children need freedom to explore on their own terms and not be exposed constantly to high levels of stimulation, such as watching television.The brain develops through hands-on experience during a lifetime, but stress can inhibit this development. Watch your children's signals to see when they are feeling overly stressed or stimulated. They will avoid, turn away, cover their face with their hands, hiccup, cry, become upset or become frustrated. Then take steps to reduce the stimulation and calm your child."}

{"label": 1, "data": "Like other reviewers I had major problems with another developer's Solitaire app, which was streaming video ads to my device with every new game. When I contacted the developer their response was that if I was on wi-fi at least it wouldn't eat my bandwidth; and that if I turned on airplane mode while I played the videos wouldn't load.That seemed like a lot of trouble for a \"free\" app, and I ended up uninstalling. Looking at this one, it looks as good as or better than the egregious ad-streaming app. It came in a free version, but to be honest being ad-free is entirely worth the dollar, especially after the horrible experience with the other app.I do wish there was a \"new game\" button anchored to the playfield. The app offers this after a winning game, but if you don't win you must open the options menu to select \"new game\". It's a small quibble, but prevents me from giving the app five stars (which I construe as perfection). However, overall the game is highly functional, easy on the eyes, and, best of all, does not hijack my device to sell me stuff. I'm happy to recommend it."}

I honestly wonder if it was some type of trick just to get their game on twitter and facebook.

This game is made for kids (based on the animations, and the fact that it is made by Disney), but if you don't lock your app store it is so easy for your kid to make purchase.

This is really evil and greedy approach.  Kind of disappointing. I'm surprised the rating is so high. From the comments I'm assuming they added this after people rated it high when it was on FAOTD, which makes this even more slimy.

{"label": 0, "data": "Loaded it on my LG Optimus V to give it a trial run.  The game is simple enough, and young kids might find it fun for the holidays, but most users should tire of its poor graphics and slow game play very quickly.The idea is that you tap Santa's sleigh when you want him to drop a present, which then drifts downward.  The hope is that you'll drop the gift into the one chimney below.  When you do this, an elf appears with the gift.  Every time you drop a present Santa says 'Ho-ho-ho'.  That's about it.Ads are scrolling across the top of the app, which is standard for about 50% of free Android apps.  Not a big deal and all things considered, probably more interesting than the Help Santa Save Christmas app.  Give it a try, but don't be surprised if you uninstall it almost as quickly as you loaded it onto your Android device."}

Tap the clue to enlarge it and see the colors, but don't try to put it in landscape or turn in different angles or or it will force close, and when it does that, it resets to the beginning of the puzzle even if you previously saved it. Then you have to start over. It is fun though, and I might have bought the other packs, but not until the force close problem is fixed."}

{"label": 1, "data": "This app is a lot of fun!  My first impression was that I loved it; however, as I worked through the pages, I started to notice some things that could be improved.  I've jotted a few of those thoughts here.Love these featuresStunning graphicsVery engaging story that is educational.A map to teach map skills! :)Narrative is in French and English, so it is bi-lingual.Good for diversity lessons.There are various treasure hunts throughout the game, and different ways to earn trophies which you put in your suitcase as you travel.You can use the trophies to create a personalized post card.The characters are interactive.  They tell their stories when you touch them.Every screen has items for the treasure hunt.The bow and arrow game is awesome.  The controls work like a real bow and arrow, where you pull back on the string more to adjust the tautness and the distance the arrow will fly.  Pretty cool!The games help to develop hand-eye coordination.Opportunity for improvementsThis is a one-player game, so it can't be shared.Narrative is in French and English, so it is bi-lingual.  However, they speak Portuguese in Brazil.  There are a few phrases in the native language, so that's good.  But why isn't the app translated into Spanish, too?  I would have loved to hear the story in Spanish, which is the second most common language in the hemisphere.The app may be trying too hard to be too much to too many children.  The age range of 3-10 makes the app attempt to be too much to too many age ranges.  So it's too easy for older children and too hard for younger ones.Narration seemed to be aimed at younger children (voice intonations), but if you turn off the sound, you can't get the entire story.On the Kindle Fire, the text box is cut off at the bottom, and you can't see the entire text.  All of the narrative is not included in the text boxes.The action in some of the games moves too slowly, and/or trips over itself (plays at same time, so you get neither).The postcard feature will only work if your device is set up for e-mail.  Otherwise, you get an error message, \"No applications can perform this action.\"Overall, it's a good app.  But it loses a star because it tries to be too much to too many people, without completely developing the ideas that are included."}

{"label": 1, "data": "Out of the three apps I tried for editing Word documents, this one seemed like the best one. I don't know how well it handles other file types because I only use it for Word documents.My problem is it wants 1. Permission to load when the phone boots and 2. Permission to reorder applications. So I'm thinking those two permissions combined will make sure the app is always running, never shutting down even of you don't use it and the operating system should shut it down.So it will degrade the quality of every other app on the device. And since Facebook has the same permissions, I'd have to wonder what happens if both of them battle to be last in line to be shut down.So three stars because it is using unnecessary resources on my phone, but actually is good for Word files. I will still force close it when I'm done though."}

I was quickly disappointed with Adobe reader; many of the features that you get with the free desktop version were just not available forth mobile app - things like read aloud,  a feature I use a lot as a young, busy mom of three.  So, I went ahead and did my research and decided to purchase this EZ Pro Reader - best money I have spent in a long time!  The read aloud feature on this app is truly amazing!

If one is not aware of any subconscious blocks or baggage from their past, that may be keeping chained to old tapes (negative self-talk), they're bound to keep repeating the same toxic behaviors and become emotionally, mentally and spiritually stagnate.The hypnosis is very relaxing, as is the narrator.  Though I have been resistant to hypnosis before, ths time I'm keeping an openmind and the fact that I can take this anywhere I go, on cell or Kindle.  I've been vigilantly listening to 2-3 different meditation, hypnosis and subliminal apps daily, for a week now.  Yeah, I got some issues, I'm a freak!  LOL. So far, it has been over a week and I could feel my heart and creative chakras open and shift.I am pleased and excited.  There is definitely a fundamental shift happening to me; After 10-years of moderate agoraphobia, I'm starting to 'want' to get back into the world.  My creative juices are flowing and for the first time in such a long time, I can't remember when I last felt hopeful about life (due to 20+ years of with multiple illnesses and chronic pain) or had aspirations!  Now ideas and creativity h as opened up and my mind is ready to Rock n' Roll, my body... er, Not so much!One of the major thing I'm looking to get out of these hypnosis and meditation apps, is to heal the traumas and remove the negative thinking, people and coping skills, which no longer serve me (more like a ginormous black pit trying to suck me back to the world of, &amp;#34;I'll never be good enough...&amp;#34;)I highly recommend MidiFi to anyone ready to grow and do more.  The free apps are effective and if you like what you hear, there are a multitude of topics to enhance your life.Today, I rate it 4-stars, as I'm trying out a couple others, in different issues.  In a few weeks I may be adding the other star.  :-)"}

{"label": 1, "data": "I got this game bundled free when I purchased the controller for the Amazon Fire TV.  Along with Asphalt 8 and Riptide GP2, it shows how much gaming goodness the Fire TV is capable of.  Graphics that are very impressive for this type of device, a decent controller, smooth gameplay, and fast load times means a fun experience.This game is simple, but fun.  It took me a bit to get used to the 3rd person controls.  The game can get a little repetitive like many of this genre, but it's a fair amount of fun and easy to just pick up and play.  I may come back and update this after I've had some more time with it, but for a freebie with the controller it's a blast and a nice showpiece for the Fire TV.It's basically a tower defense game with some 3rd person combat added in.  You fight your way through the levels, learning new tactics as you go. I've only played a few times, so cannot comment too much on the entire game itself, but I can say it's pretty impressive.  You can even get a free add-on that lets a friend provide air support from their Kindle Fire tablet.Definitely fun to be had here and a nice show piece for the Fire TV."}

The touchscreen controls, which use finger swipes to indicate the type of shot, are generally responsive.  I've not tried to use the virtial control pad options because the idea doesn't appeal to me - I want my tablet games to be simple, and simulated gamepads never work well for me.  I don't have the patience to master something where I can't feel the buttons.My only gripe with the game is that the game sometimes confuses a shot command with a movement command.  To position your player you simply touch where you'd like him to go.  The instructions tell you that the quicker you give your shot command after the other player hits the ball, the more power you'll have.  Well, if you, say, reposition your player to the center of the court, and then give a shot command while he's in motion, the game will often read that second input as another movement command, so your player will run to another part of the court.  This happens more than I would like.  I've tried to be very deliberate with my finger swipes, but it still happens.Overall, this is a great game, especially for a FAOTD.  Fun and challenging, and worth the time I've spent with it."}

{"label": 1, "data": "Very fun game to play. I also have it on my iphone. This game was loaded for my 6 year old granddaughter. It has to compete with many other kind of games she plays. I do like that this game will ask your age so they can gear it to age. She doesn't understand everything on it as far as the goals/missions but still is fun for her. She does lose interest fast and moves on to other games. This game gets extremely hard as you go up in levels. It is not hard to play but to earn acorns, money and land expansions. Acorns are almost impossible to get and the majority of the animals cost acorns. I'm sure they are doing this so we will buy acorn packs. She has a daily bonus that she gets. I don't know if that is just for kids but I don't have this on my game. Beware of updates on this game which I'm sure is important but something bad always seems to happen when these are done. She totally lost her village on one and had to start over. I did one on mine and lost all my friends and had to start over on that part. Hopefully they will get the bugs worked out of the updates quickly. Customer service does try and help out when you have problems."}

{"label": 1, "data": "This Hidden Object game is a little different. You find pieces of the object until you have the WHOLE object. I have played this game many times and will continue to do so. I downloaded it onto my Kindle Fire.LIKES:1. You get lots of hints. I didn't realize part of an orange could be so hard to find.2. You can take the plot or leave it. It doesn't have to be remembered to play the game. You can also skip scenes entirely by hitting \"next.\"3. There are lots of chapters. You find the objects in a group of 3 locations. After you have solved each chapter there are bonus objects to find under a different theme.4. A few memory games are thrown in here and there. Not too many, which I appreciate. When I want to play a HO game I want 90% of the game to be spent locating hidden objects. (I will allow wiggle room for plot which means if I have to solve logic puzzles or locks here and there I will.)5. While there aren't really instructions, the game is not hard to figure out.6. There are many chapters and so much to do that replaying the game is fun and still challenging.DISLIKES (spoiler alert):1. The zoom option seems to operate itself. I may be tapping on a grape bit and it zooms in and I have to leave that location to get it to zoom out again.2. You don't always find every object in each scene. After you gather all the objects you can, you revisit each scene and put items in place. Oranges with oranges, etc. Then when all is where it should be, the lost piece of the remaining item will appear.3. Some things were hard to figure out. The statues were solved by me frustratingly tapping the screen like mad. The tree stumps are by the totems to hold mismatched pieces while you swap them around. You can also tap one head then tap the other head and they just switch places. I use both options. I put the body parts of the statues on the stumps and then tap to switch heads.4. My most frustrating moment came in trying to ignite the hay with the magnifying glass. I eventually did it, but don't ask me how. I just kept holding the button down as long as I could.5. Which brings me to point #5. Why do I need to randomly turn on a faucet, unscrew a vent, or spend 5 minutes trying to light hay on fire? The answer is: I don't. (I'm sure this is job security for someone, but let's be honest, we both know this employee doesn't bring much to the development team anyway.) I hate not being able to figure out how to solve a problem, but what I hate even more is solving the problem and not knowing how I did it. Get rid of the whole hay/fire thing. It adds NOTHING to the game.A few more random thoughts: I did get this game free during a promotion. However, I would have gladly paid the $.99 and thought it was a fantastic deal. The graphics are cartoony, but it doesn't distract from the game. This is a HO game. No lock puzzles or math puzzles, etc. It's not rocket science so if you're expecting more than that you will be disappointed. It's a good little game. Fun to play on lunch break, the waiting room at the doctor's, or as a way to unwind after work. I will definitely buy more games from this company."}

It gives you more energy per day. #2, You do not have to spend money on ANYTHING in the game. I'm on fruit market and have not paid anything but coins from levels in the game. OK, yes. Little kids could buy stuff without you knowing. Here's a tip; don't let little Susie or Billy play the game for 6 hours while you're not paying attention! Or, better yet, teach them the value of money, and the fact it doesn't grow on trees in rainbow land. Awesome game, and very challenging. Only thing they could do better is add mini levels or something to get coins in between running out of energy."}

They had reduced the price of a bingo card to 5 bingo bucks....so now, if you win a bingo, you at least you get your money back.  The game I am referring to is Draw 5 where 5 numbers drop at one time.  There are power ups and you are able to convert your bingo bucks into these power ups.  You can win bingo bucks while playing the game.  If you are the first to win a bingo game, the payout is generous.  So, I have to take back my rant about paying 10 bingo bucks for a card and only winning 5 buck back if you get a bingo...which would make anyone a perpetual looser.  That's not true anymore. YEAH!"}

So I was excited to play a game where I got to build a really cool park with those dinosaurs in the spotlight. And then...I played this. The gameplay isn't bad, but that, I would say, is it's only redeeming factor. The sound is atrocious, so I have to play with no volume whatsoever. When you have twenty dinosaurs and they all make sounds when you click on them (hence collecting coins from them), it gives you a headache rather quickly. My biggest issue though? The overwhelming amount of money you would have to sink into this game to get everything you could. When certain dinosaurs equal $20 (or more), it's hitting a point of insanity. Do I want a tyrannosaurus? Duh. Do I want to pay X amount of dollars to have that dinosaur in a video game? No. And, though you can collect virtual 'dollars' to spend on those dinosaurs, they are few and far between. Overall, the game is a decent time-waster...if you don't feel like shelling out money to get in-game goodies."}

{"label": 0, "data": "This game comes very close to being a very good hidden object game. Gameplay is simple: find hidden objects. No mini-games, no story-wrapper cruft - just hidden objects set against beautiful and well-crafted fantasy backgrounds. Exactly what I like best.But.The UI is slow to respond and there is no feedback about when or if you have clicked. This is most noticeable on the menus - for example, when you tap \"Play\" and nothing happens for a full two seconds, every time. At first I thought there was something wrong with the installation, but no - it's just slow. And while UI slowness might be most noticeable in the menus, it is deadly to fun gameplay. \"There's the sword!\" *tap* \"Hmm.\" *tap tap* \"Oh, there it goes.\" *sigh* (Every time.)Worse, however, is the number of clicks the game just never responded to at all: \"There's the bat!\" *tap* \"Hmm.\" *tap tap* \"C'mon, it's not like I don't know what it looks like! It's a bloody flying mammal!\" *tap tap tap TAP TAP* *cursing* (I eventually used a hint to highlight the bat and got the game to register my tap while it was glowing. The UI seemed more sensitive when I was using hints - which at least let me move on. I used the hint trick this way several times ... until I ran out of hints.)It doesn't help that the objects are absolutely tiny - smaller than I have ever seen in a game of this sort before even in games meant for a larger screen that allow zooming, which this one does not. I like pouring over a detailed scene searching for the elusive button. I'd rather not give myself a migraine while doing so. One later level I played has a pair of scissors on the floor that is so tiny that even after using a hint to find it I identified it as 'scissors' only by a couple of stereotypical scissor-orange pixels.If I had found this game playable, I might have dinged it a few points for a lack of music and gameplay modes such as find-by-silhouette. (Apparently you can fiddle with the time-based play, but I couldn't get the menu button to respond to me so I never saw it myself.) It would have earned extra points for the gorgeous art and the carefully crafted arrangement of objects that seem to lay out the framework of a narrative. (If you've read some of my other reviews, you know I'm a sucker for that.) Unfortunately, without being able to actually tap the hidden objects when I find them, the rest doesn't really matter.Ah, one final comment: When the game says 'cigar', it apparently means 'pipe'."}

Disappointing.The problems with Amazon's IAP system, for those who haven't yet read them:* Amazon actively discourages people from turning OFF in-app purchases. In order to prevent IAP presently, the user must know his or her account login information and use it to turn them OFF inside the Amazon store app. That is a BAD THING. It should be very easy to turn off - simply go to the setting and select \"off\"! That level of security - using account credentials - should be the only way to enable IAP at the device, and to do so specifically. But that still relies on device security, which is not enough.* You might not know (but some kids have discovered) that resetting the device's Amazon store app will turn back on IAP (enabled is the default setting), so when the parent goes to do something with an Amazon app the parent is prompted for his or her account credentials and the parent will most likely not realize that IAP is now re-enabled for the device.* Some developers are making the games intentionally extremely difficult to artificially encourage In-App Purchases.* Many IAPs are for \"disposable\" or \"one-time-use\" items.  Not only that, several don't transfer from one device to another, or even survive uninstallation and reinstallation.Good luck and watch your back; it's becoming a jungle out there."}

{"label": 0, "data": "First thing I tried to do with this app was load a photo of my face taken outdoors.  The app appears to have difficulty finding edges, as there was very little detail, and in particular, no eyes.  When I colored the image in, it gave me this weird pasty skin, like I had leprosy or something.  I tried again, this time with a portrait taken indoors.  It did a slightly better job, though this time it greatly overemphasized my glasses.  After coloring it in, it made me look like I was wearing a ton of makeup.  I tried a third time using a baby photo and the results made me laugh out loud (I've saved that one and will upload it to Amazon).OK, so maybe this doesn't work so well for faces.  Maybe it'll work better with landscapes.  But I'll never be able to find out, because the app kept giving me \"out of RAM\" errors for every single landscape photo I tried.I tried again with a photo I took of some flowers. The results looks rather like hand-drawn semi-cartoony flowers over a photo background.  I kind of like the effect.I tried yet again with some animal photos.  And yet again, I was plagued by \"out of RAM\" messages.  I finally managed to load a photo of our black & white mantle Great Dane.  The line art was almost unrecognizable, but when colored in looked like a passable painting of a dog.  I tried loading a photo of a brown-colored donkey and he came out grey when colored in.  Finally, I loaded a photo of a rabbit in the grass.  The line art was a jumbled mass of lines; colored in it took on an impressionist appearance.Overall, the app is unimpressive.  It works well with some photos but utterly butchers others.  The \"out of RAM\" errors make loading an image unpredictable at best.  There is no undo function, so you can't make any mistakes!  The brush often stutters if you move your finger at anything faster than a snail's pace.  Accidentally touching the screen with a second finger tosses the image across the screen and/or resizes it and it is difficult to impossible to get it back the way it was."}

Why make payments for a fully paid app?The game has:* Active access to your internet* Reads your personal data as it reads your device data* It wants to be notified when your device has finished booting* Accesses your storage area* Even though I left the game it runs in the backgroundI played the game for a while and I found it not to be a lot of fun.  You spin the wheel to find an amount to play for and even though you may know the answer to the puzzle you normally get only one letter to choose at a time.  In addition the game may choose to not allow you to select vowels. I found the game to be slow and not that much fun.  It is like a poor version of Wheel of Fortune.

You can watch tons of free content like NY times, Revision 3, Discover channel right on your tablet and is seen to work great! without any buffering issues - Earlier one needed to download specific app from those streaming media providers for that purpose, this nifty app does it all and IMHO quite beautifully presented.To add to the list of goodies If you have a compatible TV or a streaming media device likeWD TV Liveconnected to your TV you can push the video to that device and it will play just fine. Basically this is all-in-one solution for media enthusiastic person who has tons of media on the device or stacked somewhere on a NAS share on local LAN may it be those precious family photos or videos which you can watch directly on the Android tablet or push that content to TV to share with family or friends.The app discovers DLNA shares on your local LAN without any difficulty and I was able to stream off myWD My Book Live DuoNAS share and view photos and videos effortlessly. You do need to have compatible media for it to work or it will hand it off to other apps installed apps that will play the video or music files for you on your Android tablet.I useMX Playerfor my videos and it works great on my Samsung Galaxy Tab 10.1! check that app out and you will find that thisiMediaSharehas great potential when used together for playing local media on your NAS share and DLNA servers on your local network.For a FAOTD this is a gem!

Well i should say the botton layout options are top rate and at first you'll be in heaven untill you're in a tuff fire fight and your character suddenly decides to turn around due to no fault of your own and leaves you disoriented and taking big punishment. It's sad but hopefully can be fixed with an update. it also seems to be running at a poor frame rate maybe just on the kindle but it gives off the feeling that it's a bit jumpy and feels choppy to the point he almost looks like he is skipping not walking it just isnt all that smooth. probably as good as it may get for a first person shooter game on ios or android but it doesn't do much to push the argument  that tablets and smart phones are replacing dedicated handhelds such as the ps vita... but they're getting real close.

{"label": 0, "data": "Either Amazon, the developer, or both need to get their act together when approving description permissions listed in an app.  This is normally a PAID app, and customers who have already paid or will pay for it shouldn't have to find this out AFTER the payment has been made.  They need to recognize some folks rely on accurate descriptions before making purchases, and perhaps might not have purchased it at at ALL if the app requests more than what was stated.  Surely Amazon should have checked this, and I'm sure the developer knows how the listing was going to read, or at least does NOW and should be contacting Amazon to make the corrections.The current description states it asks for internet access and network information only.The ACTUAL permissions are read phone state and ID, full internet access, and access to the SD card contents.  Since there is now actual access to the SD, it changes the playing field as to what the open sockets (internet) can collect, added to the phone calls permission listed clearly upon download.I have yet to open and give the game a try, but until the actual permissions are listed correctly and the customers accordingly notified, this is the best I can do in rating an app that hidden permissions undisclosed.  It also shows whoever is responsible for this that ACCURATE PERMISSIONS are a serious subject and better attention needs to be paid in listing exactly what was found when the app was TESTED."}

{"label": 0, "data": "Overview: Pocketbooth does exactly what you'd think, it takes 3-4 pictures in succession and puts them into a photobooth style grid. There's a few effects, and you can customize the color of the frame and the amount of time between shots.Pros: It makes this process extremely easy, so for a lot of people this could be a lot of fun. More interesting to share 4 pics of something similar in this fashion, almost like a comic strip. And taking a bunch of pictures with your friends is definitely a good time. It's simple, and easy to use, so for all of that it's not a bad app to have. After your picture is ready, you can share it to whatever you'd like(facebook, twitter, email, messaging, etc).Cons: The real con here is there's not enough here to justify spending $2. Any other day of the week this thing costs way too much money for what it does. There's a few apps that do this for $1(Spark Booth Mini), a couple that do it for free(PhotoBooth). And a lot of full-fledged camera apps, like camera zoom, that will do this and a hell of a lot more for a couple dollars more. Not that many effects, and you can't change the template of the grid. 4 pics in a row is ok, but having different layouts would at least add some dimension to this app. This outputs a jpg that is 489 x 2608, which isn't bad, but you have no control over the resolution.Should you buy? Quickly put, no. Don't pay money for this. If doing this straight from your phone is necessary, grab it today. At this point, most people can just throw these together on their computers using photoshop and a number of other applications, having way more control over the result..If you missed out on having it for free, still want the convenience of doing it straight on the phone, don't waste your time or money. Grab Photobooth on the app market and enjoy it for free.Phone: Droid X (Android 2.2.1, Liberty 2.0.1)"}

Quests, mechanics, characters which are reduced to 4 classes and 5 races.Nice graphics and so far no bugs in quests.Good options for pvp and pve players although there are only a few dungeons no heroic or normal mode.Cons:What I really dont like are in game payments. If you want some epic gear ir pet or amount of gold you have to pay so ridiculous high price that its almost unbeliviable for me to do soCamera have to be set by finger. This is unusual especialy if you are used to play with mouse. In the other way i dont imagine better solution for controls in that game and if you play it for longer period you will find it quite comfortable. Still for hardcore pvp players it is relevant obstacle to achieve their maximum game performance without a mouse connected.There are still reserves in chat. I would like to have an option to write to certain person right throught the main chat window.Summary:Very goog game wich i hope will get better and better. I hope it wont brought low after Gameloft had canceled monthly fees. There are a few mistakes but still this games provides very good MMORPG experience and i wish Gameloft luck to keep up with thier good work."}

All these things can be ignore it if you are a very novice player, however I require a little bit more of a challenge, and a game that actually has a mission. This game all you do is run and until. if you run out of time the game ends.

Collecting things to sell can only be obtained by killing something, randomly finding things floating in space (rare), or mining asteroids in PVP space. There is no planet to planet trade system. The only market that exists is the player one. I don't want to be a merchant by relying on random npc and resource spawns and sitting there waiting for my 2 dps weapon to dig into the center of an npc ship hull, or by going towards an asteroid to mine it only to be massacred by a player in a fighter career. Make no mistake, this is a fighting only game (fighting mechanics are also boring). This game could learn some lessons from Galaxy On Fire's trader systems. Also, the learning curve is fairly high and is a sign of a poorly made game. I am proud to say I read ALL the tutorial pages and played for a good while before reviewing. Finally, this game has really unimpressive interfaces and graphics. I realize graphics don't make a game, but (1) usability/accessibility DOES matter, and (2) when this is the App age and games like Galaxy on Fire 2 exist, I see little value in this game. Moreover, GOF3 is going MMO!"}

It just got repetitive and old after a few minutes. The graphics don't change so you're just running through the same stuff - trees, bush, headstone.

{"label": 1, "data": "This conversion of a 2004 title is probably the best looking RPG available for Android devices, especially if you play it on a high-end tablet. The gorgeous graphics are matched by the game's snarky sense of humor: It pokes good-natured fun at just about every RPG convention, from monsters that seem to carry the contents of a treasure house in their bodies to brave heroes out to save the princess. But hard core role playing gamers be warned: This is definitely RPG-lite. There's no inventory management and no bargainning with merchants. In fact you have nothing to sell, since all treasure, except for immediately useful weapons and healing stones, is instantly converted to cash. There's also no magic system and no weapon and armor crafting. There is, however, a lot of fast-moving (the hours-long installation excepted), gorgeous, funny action."}

I was figuring I'd get statistics on qwerty keyboards and the like. Instead, it turns out that there's a star by that name and I got tons of info on that, instead. Unfortunately, I wasn't interested, but had no way of telling the app that it had the wrong qwerty. It should offer choices, like wikipedia offers the disambiguation pages.So, my second search was more specialized. &quot;texas adult protective services&quot; should give some information, any information, about that department.

Heck, I didnt pay anything for this one and still feel ripped off. At least this moved to SD card, thats the only good thing I can say but isnt that expected anyway? Most of their apps dont move to SD, so makes you wonder why they did not design the others to go to SD. At least we know now they know how to do it, so its more like being very lazy instead of being very strange.The analytics added for the first time in one of their apps also disturbed me, makes you wonder what else they are cooking up for the future. But that does not disturb me as much as dev following reviewers around and arguing with them. That gave me the creeps. I dont mind a dev saying a feature exists or where to find a menu button, stuff like that. Thats helpful stuff, not defensive stuff. But they had their chance to describe things and write about it, or just decide to take stuff out before it went live. So they should pretty much stay out of it, esp. not dogging down customers, just take the lumps and let the chips fall where they may.Its like after a presidential debate on TV, then having a talk show discussion of guests interrupted by one of the candidates pushing his way into the studio demanding to still talk and argue with the commentators. Its just creepy and wrong."}
{"label": 0, "data": "The game has the making of being really good but the implementation is short of what I had hoped for.  The puzzles are hard enough that it makes you think, but solvable.  No much instruction on the puzzles and their or no hints to solve it, so it you get stuck, you've got to skip.  There is a penalty for skipping.  The hidden object screens are bad.  You've got to find pieces of a tool that you will use, but the scenes are dark and the pieces are so small and hidden in the dark screens that it makes it frustrating to find.  I found myself hitting the hint button a lot.  Besides the ratio of puzzles to hidden object screens makes this game, at times, boring.  The walkthrough play is pretty good as you must remember a lot.  You do go back an forward a bit, but I don't mind this as it adds some complexity to the game.  The $2.99 price tag is a bit more than I would have liked to spend, but then I think I got my monies worth."}

I really wanted to like this game, but after all of your hard work and long hours are wiped out, there is no real reason to all start over again.I hope the programmers are aware of this and will fix the problem, for there are people that will spend their real money for upgrades to find them wiped out some days later.

A continent is chosen (Africa, Asia, Australia [Oceania], Europe, North America or South America). The player then learns about the countries in that continent on flash cards that contain the country and information about it - name, capital, flag, official languages, major cities and landmarks, and it can be viewed in a map as well. If you want to launch just into game play, you can do that, too. Players earn countries each time a round is completed. A fun game for kids and adults, both."}

Rayman is a video game that trascends age, fun for 8 to 80 years olds....REALLY.  Although Ubisoft has not reissued the original games (Rayman, II, Gold, Arena, etc.) for current gaiming platforms, they did a great job with Jungle Run.  It's an engaging game, challenging but not so difficult that it gets frustrating moving from level to level.  As with all Ubisoft games, the graphics, vivid colors, easy controller actions and story-line make it hard for you to lose interest in the game.  Now if we can only get them to reissue those alder Rayman titles to work on Androids or PCs, all would be good with the world."}

I really like this series.Game description: you have a lot of funny scenes to go thru.  In those scenes, you have a lot of items u need to use, but you need to locate &#34;pieces&#34; of the items in those scenes and a lot of the pieces are scattered. You have to go to different scenes at different times. While you look for pieces for an item, you may find all the pieces in that scene at 1st, but, if not, you will need go to another scene, do something there that will unlock a piece, or multiple pieces, in the other scene. Lol sounds confusing but really, it's quite fun.  Some of the mini games in this game won't allow you to move pieces if you're playing with Kindle Fire. So, unfortunately, I had to use the skip button to move forward. This is 1 of the reasons I only gave this app 3 stars. Another reason was because this one was not very long at all and didn't have as good a story or humor as the 1st  1 did.Overall, I still would recommend this app.  I would just make sure you're aware of the glitches and such."}

{"label": 0, "data": "Vam Jump is a simple endless jumper game where the objective is to keep your vampire alive as he jumps upward via platforms. Along the way, you'll encounter power ups that boost your jump. You must avoid stuff like garlic that kills you. Some platforms are trick platforms that disintegrate when you land on them. The only control you have is tilting your phone left or right. That's pretty much it. No elaborate back story or any other game play.The tilt control was a bit jittery and imprecise at the default setting. Fortunately there is a sensitivity setting  on the home screen where you can adjust the tilt control. The game control was better and more precise for me after I dialed down the sensitivity.Overall, it's an okay game that will get boring pretty fast for adults and older kids. It's essentially a dumbed down version of a game like temple run. It's pretty overpriced at $2.99. I definitely wouldn't have paid full price for this game. Even $0.99 is a stretch.

Parental control is recommended, especially if you don't want the kids to purchase some of the items to continue the game or upgrading. This app offers cars/carts that run up to $50. Yes, it's up to the buyer/player.  I'm aware that the app has a warning of in-app purchasing, but really, do you want to pay that amount of money. I enjoy the other angry bird games. I don't find this app enjoyable, especially when these birds are racing, they get tired (they need energy). You need gems to recharge the birds. So, you can either wait and be patient for about 20 minutes or buy more gems. Like I said, I found it pricey & the options that makes you pay money to continue to play was not worth it to me."}

{"label": 1, "data": "Everybody in my family likes mahjong, so this is going to get loaded on a lot of Kindle Fires and smartphones today.It is a very nice implementation of mahjong with many different layouts (standard/classic, bridges, mountains, etc., etc., etc....40 different layouts to choose from), tile types (different materials, different images), and a few different backgrounds. You can even zoom in and out on the pile.There is a lot of animation being used...flashing tiles when you select them, stuff flying off the board, etc., so if you have a very old tablet or phone, it might be a bit overwhelming, but I had no lag or anything with either my Kindle Fire HD or Galaxy S4.The one knock I found is that there are so many things on the screen...score, timer, buttons to push for options, etc, etc., etc.,...that sometimes a tile gets covered up by something and you can't (or at least I couldn't) drag the pile around on the screen to see what was being hidden so I had to zoom out to see it then zoom back in to make selecting tiles easier.None of my hardware monitors reported any issues, I played it for a while and didn't see any ads, and the program exits cleanly leaving nothing running the background.If you like Mahjong, there is no reason not to get this as the Free App of the Day. When it returns to the $3 asking price...that seems a bit high to me. $1.99 would be a, &#34;You should get it if you really like Mahjong&#34; price point and $1.49 or cheaper would be a, &#34;Just get it already, it's definitely worth it&#34; price."}

Try to separate them and it crashes most of the time. Or try to change the instrument on a track and it crashes too. Now remember this is with my own files that it has issues with.

I kept thinking I'd get to the nine square sudoku but after twenty rounds,  I was still on the training squares.  I didn't have the patience to keep going, so I removed the game from my Kindle.  It might be great, however, for a young beginning sudoku player."}

{"label": 0, "data": "I downloaded this app on my phone as the FAOTD and decided to play with it a while before deciding if it was a keeper or an archiver.  I found it interesting and educational. In fact, I thought, it might be something my students might enjoy playing on my tablet (which is also connected to the same Amazon account). I looked in the cloud, in the device (in case I had a CRS moment), and in the updates. No luck.  But on my phone it is there, on the website it is there.  I could buy the app again on my tablet-- in theory-- maybe. So I  am wondering what the issue is?  Is it some weird rule from the developer?  An Amazon glitch? The game itself is probably worth 4 stars-- if I could access it on a bigger screen-- which at present I cannot. So I might never know."}

{"label": 1, "data": "I downloaded this because I love the TV Gameshow the Price is Right. This game is alright, I think what really takes away from it is the beginning. As in the TV game show, you must guess the price of the item they are presented with. If you do not get it right, then you do not get to proceed to the games. You get about four shots with four different items, then you have to restart the game.Otherwise, this is a great game once you guess the price on the first item.... the first item up for bids..The graphics are great on Kindle Fire."}

The HO scenes are a bit easy, but do relate to objects needed in the game.  Unfortunately, I have a bad memory and cannot remember far enough back to know where an item needs to be used.  I find myself having to use the hint button to help me find where items are to be used.  It's not that you need to &quot;think&quot; as with logic based games; you just need to be able to remember where a large number of objects were needed.  Feel a bit as if the game is playing me."}

Also, I wish it would run when I click off the active phone light and run &#34;on top&#34; as I need to access the phone or text on my Droid, which is where I use it."}

{"label": 1, "data": "They did an excellent job on this game. Its fun and addicting. Not to mention the fact that although the levels are challenging they aren't too difficult. The only thing I dont like is the awkward pricing. You get an option to choose between 5 characters if I'm not mistaken but 4 of those characters you have to pay to unlock. Its bad enough that you have to pay for them but they cost two dollars a piece...I would've preferred if we could just unlock them by fulfilling requirements or at the very least be 99 cents.I'm all for in app purchasing but only if those purchases apply to convenience, not locking away parts of the game but that's just my opinion. Other than that, the game is good. You should definitely try it out."}

It's a fun game, but so full of bugs that I'm amazed that anyone would release it.I had fun playing it this morning.  Had no problems.  Then I went back to finish my game.  I had turned the sounds all the way down, but when I came back the sound was blaring. I went to turn it down - well it WAS still turned down.  Had to turn it up then back down.No app2sd was still bugging me.  Why aren't developers today taking care of that?  I've noticed everyone complaining about the black screen of death so tried to recreate that myself.  Took a bit, but I finally managed it.  Seems when a giant birdie came along with an egg they didn't like each other.  Guess those eggs are the problem somehow.Maybe the dev is reading these finally and will leave some comments.  I'd really like to keep this app.  I love match three games and this is a nice combo of Chuzzle and match 3."}
